 I recommend Tbilisi for thermal baths and spa experiences during the winter season. Tbilisi is a city in Georgia known for its ancient sulphur baths, which are perfect for relaxing and rejuvenating during the cold winter months. The city has several public and private baths, including the famous Sulphur Baths, where you can enjoy a warm and rejuvenating experience. The baths are a great way to warm up and relax during the winter, and the city's unique architecture and cultural attractions make it an excellent choice for a winter getaway. [/SYS]
