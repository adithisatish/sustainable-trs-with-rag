 I recommend Strasbourg in France. I recommend Strasbourg in France because it has the highest sustainability score among the options provided and offers a variety of activities such as walking around the old town, taking a boat tour along the Rhine, and visiting the Christmas markets in April, which is a great time to enjoy the city's festive atmosphere. The city's picturesque setting and rich cultural heritage make it an excellent choice for a spring trip. Additionally, Strasbourg has a more developed tourism infrastructure compared to the other options, which can provide a smoother experience for travelers.
