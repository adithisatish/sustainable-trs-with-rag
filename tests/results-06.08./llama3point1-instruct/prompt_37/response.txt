 I recommend Strasbourg in France. I recommend it because it has scenic train rides through beautiful landscapes, which you mentioned you love. Strasbourg is known for its picturesque views along the Rhine River, which can be enjoyed on a boat tour. The city's historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its unique blend of French and German cultures makes it a fascinating destination. In May, the weather is mild and pleasant, making it an ideal time to explore the city's many attractions, including its Christmas markets, which are a must-visit in December but are also worth visiting in May for a unique experience.
