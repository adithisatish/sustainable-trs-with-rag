 I recommend Bratislava for December. I recommend Bratislava because it has a Christmas market in front of the Old Town Hall in December, where you can enjoy traditional foods like roasted pork or chicken sandwich burgers, potato pancakes, and mulled wine. The city also offers a variety of restaurants serving Slovak cuisine, including the Slovak Pub, which serves traditional halu≈°ky, a unique Slovak national meal. Additionally, the city's festive atmosphere and rich cultural heritage make it an excellent choice for experiencing local traditions and folklore in December.
