 I recommend Stockholm in Sweden for your travel. I recommend Stockholm in spring because the city has many historical palaces and royal residences that are perfect for exploration during this season. The weather is mild and pleasant, making it an ideal time to visit the beautiful gardens and outdoor spaces surrounding the palaces. Additionally, the spring season allows you to see the palaces in their full glory, with blooming flowers and lush greenery adding to their beauty. The Grand Palace and Drottningholm Palace are must-visit attractions in Stockholm, and visiting them in the spring will make for a memorable experience. The city also has a vibrant cultural scene, with many festivals and events taking place during the spring season, making it an excellent time to visit.

Buildings and structures

Untouched by wars for a long time, Stockholm has some great old architecture to see. The exception would be [[Stockholm/Norrmalm|Norrmalm]], where much was demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to give place to what was then more modern buildings. Looking at it the other way around, if interested in this kind of architecture this is the place to go.
Stockholm's [[Stockholm/Gamla stan|'''Old Town''' (''Gamla Stan'')]], is the beautifully preserved historical center, best covered on foot, dominated by the '''Stockholm Palace''' (Stockholms slott). Other highlights include '''Storkyrkan''', the cathedral of Stockholm, which has been used for many royal coronations, weddings and funerals, and '''Riddarholmskyrkan''', a beautifully preserved medieval church, which hosts the tombs of many Swedish kings and royals, surrounded by former mansions.

As a matter of fact, there's not only one royal palace in and around Stockholm but several others, '''Drottningholm''' (on [[Ekerö]]) and '''Haga''' (in [[Solna]]) being the most famous. Here visitors can get in close contact with traditions of the Swedish monarchy. The Drottningholm palace, a {{unesco}}, is where the royal family lives; still much of it is open to the public. The surroundings are well worth a walk as well. In summer, there is a [ regular boat service] from Stadshuskajen (the City Hall Quay) to Drottningholm.
Stockholm has several interesting [[Christianity|churches]], from medieval times to the 20th century. Most of them are in active use by the Church of Sweden. There is also a synagogue in [[Stockholm/Östermalm|Östermalm]] and a mosque on [[Stockholm/Södermalm|Södermalm]]. The Woodland cemetery, ''Skogskyrkogården'', in [[Stockholm/Söderort|Söderort]] is one of few UNESCO World Heritage sites from the 20th century. Also in southern Stockholm is '''Avicii Arena''', also known as '''Globen''' ("Globe", in [[Stockholm/Söderort|Söderort]]), a white spherical building used for hockey games and as a concert venue. Occasionally, at least at game nights, it is lit by coloured light. The Globe is the heart of the [[Sweden Solar System]], the world's largest scale model of any kind. With the Globe as the Sun, models of the planets are displayed at Sl
