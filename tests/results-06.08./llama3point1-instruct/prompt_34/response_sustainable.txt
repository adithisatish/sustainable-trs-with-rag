 I recommend Stockholm in Sweden for your travel in the spring. I recommend it because Stockholm is home to several historical palaces and royal residences, including the Stockholm Palace, Drottningholm Palace, and Haga Palace. The spring season is ideal for visiting these sites as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it perfect for walking tours and outdoor activities. Additionally, the city's beautiful parks and gardens are in full bloom during the spring, adding to the city's charm. Stockholm's rich history and cultural heritage, combined with its picturesque scenery, make it an ideal destination for exploring historical palaces and royal residences in the spring.
