I recommend Munich in Germany for the film festival in May because the city has a variety of film festivals and events that take place in May, including the Lange Nacht der Musik, which is an all-night event in May with 400 concerts and other musical events. This event is a great opportunity to experience the city's vibrant music scene and enjoy a variety of performances. Additionally, the Tollwood festival, which takes place in Olympic Park in northern Munich, is a music festival that typically occurs in May and June.
