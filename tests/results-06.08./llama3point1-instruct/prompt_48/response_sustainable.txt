 I recommend Warsaw in Poland. I recommend Warsaw because it has a variety of festivals and events in May, including the Orange Warsaw Festival, which is a big pop music festival, and the Long Night of Museums, which allows visitors to explore museums and galleries past midnight. The city also has a rich cultural scene, with the Polish National Opera and the Warsaw Philharmonic, and a vibrant atmosphere with many festivals and events throughout the year. Additionally, Warsaw has a good sustainability score of 0.352 in May, making it a suitable choice for travelers who care about the environment. [/INST]
