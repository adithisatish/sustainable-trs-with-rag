 I recommend Samsun, Turkey, as the ideal summer destination. Samsun offers a beautiful beach life, with options like Atakum Beach and Fener Beach, suitable for different preferences. The city also features various parks, such as Atatürk Park, East Park, and West Park, where you can relax and enjoy the scenic views. Additionally, Samsun has a vibrant cultural scene, with the opportunity to attend festivals like the Bike Festival and the Festival of OMÜ, which take place in June. The city's proximity to nearby geothermal spas, such as Hilas Geothermal Spa, is also a plus. Overall, Samsun seems to be an excellent choice for a summer vacation in Europe, offering a mix of beach activities, cultural experiences, and relaxation.
