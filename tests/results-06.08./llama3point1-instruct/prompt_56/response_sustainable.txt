 I recommend Strasbourg because it has a high sustainability score for August, and it offers a variety of activities such as exploring the pedestrian-friendly city centre, visiting the European Parliament, and participating in the annual winter market. Additionally, it has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, with a main tourist office that provides free maps and self-guided walking tours.
