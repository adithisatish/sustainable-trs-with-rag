 I recommend Strasbourg is a city in France.Here is some information about the city. * Walking around the old town is a very nice way to pass a day. And there are lots of good cafes to stop and rest in as you make your tour.
* '''Boat tours''' along the Rhine offer views over both Strasbourg and neighbouring Germany. [ Batorama] offer several river tours lasting from around 45 minutes to a few hours, costing around €10 per person. 45-min tours run around the town center and the European district. Boats can be found below {{lang|fr|Place du Marché aux Poissons}}.
* '''Football:''' [ RC Strasbourg Alsace] play soccer in Ligue 1, the top tier in France. Their home ground Stade de la Meinau (capacity 26,300) is 2 km south of town centre. 
* '''[[Christmas Markets]]''' can be found in many places, but the most important and beautiful are {{lang|fr|place Broglie}} and {{lang|fr|place de la Cathédrale}}, although they are crowded. They are the best places to drink hot wine (''{{lang|fr|vin chaud}}'') and to eat Christmas cookies (''Brädeles''). I recommend Strasbourg as the city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame and the town fortifications. The city also has a rich history and culture, with many museums, theaters, and festivals throughout the year. The Christmas Markets are a must-visit during the winter months, and the boat tours along the Rhine offer a unique perspective on the city and its surroundings. Additionally, Strasbourg is a great base to explore the nearby Alsace region, known for its picturesque villages, castles, and vineyards. I recommend visiting Strasbourg in the summer months to enjoy the city's outdoor cafes and restaurants, as well as the many festivals and events that take place during this time.
