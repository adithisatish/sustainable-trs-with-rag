 I recommend Plovdiv for you because it is an excellent choice for exploring historical ruins and ancient sites in March. The city offers a rich history, with many well-preserved ancient structures, including the old town, which is a must-visit. The pleasant spring weather in March makes it an ideal time to walk through the cobblestone streets and explore the many historical sites. Additionally, the city's cultural events, such as the Plovdiv Jazz Nights, can be a great experience. Furthermore, the nearby Bachkovo Monastery and Asenovgrad Krepost are great day trip options, offering a glimpse into the region's history and natural beauty. Overall, Plovdiv's unique blend of history, culture, and natural scenery makes it an excellent choice for your travel plans. [/SYS]
