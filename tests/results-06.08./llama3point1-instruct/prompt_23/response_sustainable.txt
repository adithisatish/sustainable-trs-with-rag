 I recommend Plovdiv because it has a rich history and a plethora of historical ruins and ancient sites to explore, such as the Old Town, the Hills, and the Bachkovo Monastery. The city's sustainability score in March is 0.062, indicating a relatively high level of sustainability. Additionally, the city hosts the Folk/Jazz music festival, which aligns with the user's interest in exploring historical ruins and ancient sites. The ideal month for visiting Plovdiv is March, as the weather is mild and the city is less crowded compared to the peak tourist season. [/SYS]
