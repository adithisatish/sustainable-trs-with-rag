 I recommend Van, Turkey. I recommend Van because it is a great destination for birdwatching, particularly in April when many species of waterbirds are migrating. Lake Er√ßek, located about 30 km east of Van, is an important site for these birds, with over 180 species documented, including several endangered species. This makes Van an ideal location for wildlife photography and birdwatching enthusiasts. Additionally, the city's beaches and scenic views provide a picturesque backdrop for your trip.
