 I recommend Stavanger, Norway because it is a great destination for scenic mountain villages in January. The city has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters, making it perfect for hiking and climbing in the winter months. The Preikestolen Plateau and Kjerag Boulder are popular attractions that can be reached by bus, and the city has many hiking trails and marked routes for hikers. Additionally, the city has a beautiful coastline with many beaches, including the popular Sola Beach, which is great for surfing. Overall, Stavanger offers a great combination of natural beauty, outdoor activities, and a mild winter climate, making it an ideal destination for those looking for scenic mountain villages in January.
