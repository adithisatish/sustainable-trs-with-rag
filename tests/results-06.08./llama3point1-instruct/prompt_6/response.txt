 I recommend Cagliari in Italy. I recommend Cagliari because it has a good mix of shopping, beautiful areas that could remind you of Copenhagen's Strøget, and it is a great place to visit in March. In March, the weather is usually mild and sunny, making it perfect for exploring the city's historic center and visiting the shops in Via Roma and Largo Carlo Felice. Additionally, the city's cultural events and festivals in March, such as the "Salone del Mobile" (Salone del Mobile) make it an ideal destination for you. [/SYS]
