 I recommend Strasbourg, France, for its quaint villages and rural landscapes in the autumn. Strasbourg is a city in the Grand Est region of France and is known for its picturesque countryside and charming villages. The autumn season brings a picturesque landscape with the changing foliage, and the city's historic center is a must-visit destination. You can explore the city's pedestrian-friendly streets, visit the famous Strasbourg Cathedral, and enjoy the local cuisine. Additionally, the nearby countryside offers numerous opportunities for hiking and exploring the natural beauty of the region. The ideal month to visit Strasbourg in the autumn is September or October, when the weather is mild and the foliage is at its peak.
