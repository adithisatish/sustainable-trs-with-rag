 I recommend Munich, Germany for September. I recommend Munich because it hosts the famous Oktoberfest, which is a vibrant cultural festival that takes place in September. It's a world-famous event that attracts millions of visitors from around the globe, offering a unique experience with traditional food, drinks, music, and festivities. The city is also filled with other exciting events and activities in September, such as the Isar Island Festival, which is a street fair along the river bank, providing a lively atmosphere with food, drinks, and entertainment. With the pleasant autumn weather, September is an ideal time to visit Munich and experience its cultural festivals and events.
