 I recommend Kaunas, Lithuania for experiencing the northern lights. The best time to visit Kaunas is May to August, but the summer months are the ideal time to witness the northern lights, with frequent clear skies and the longest nights. The city's location in the northern part of Lithuania makes it an excellent spot to see the aurora borealis. Additionally, the city's unique cultural and historical heritage, including its well-preserved medieval old town and numerous museums, will provide a fascinating experience. The provided context does not have the answer.
