 I recommend Hamburg as the best city to experience the northern lights in December. I recommend Hamburg because it is located in Germany, which is one of the best places to see the northern lights in Europe, and December is one of the best months to view this phenomenon. Hamburg has a high sustainability score of 0.328 in December, which suggests that it is a responsible and environmentally friendly destination. Additionally, Hamburg has a range of accommodation options, including hotels and budget accommodations, which can cater to different budgets and preferences. While the other options, such as Strasbourg and Arkhangelsk, may also offer opportunities to see the northern lights, Hamburg's unique combination of location, sustainability, and accommodation options make it the best choice for this experience. The provided context does not have the answer. [/SYS]
