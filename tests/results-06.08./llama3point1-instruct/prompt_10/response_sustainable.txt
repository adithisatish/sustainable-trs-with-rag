 I recommend Kaunas as the best city for you to visit in October. Kaunas offers a rich medieval history with many preserved Gothic and Baroque buildings, including the Old Town, Kaunas Castle, and various churches. The city has a strong sense of history and culture, with many museums and historical sites to explore. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Kaunas in October is 0.169, indicating a relatively high level of sustainability. Additionally, the city's architecture and history align with your interest in medieval architecture and castles. While Strasbourg and Mykolaiv also have interesting historical sites, Kaunas' unique blend of Gothic and Baroque styles, as well as its well-preserved Old Town, make it the most appealing destination for you.
