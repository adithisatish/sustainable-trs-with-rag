 I recommend Nicosia for you. Nicosia is a city in Cyprus, known for its rich culinary heritage, blending Greek, Turkish, and Middle Eastern influences. In September, the weather is warm and pleasant, making it an ideal time to visit. You can enjoy the local tavernas, where you can try traditional Cypriot dishes like the mixed pork kebab with a chilled local beer. The city's cuisine is characterized by its use of fresh ingredients, and you can find a variety of restaurants serving Greek, Turkish, and Middle Eastern cuisine. The city's shopping district is dotted with local tavernas, and you can find affordable dining options. I recommend trying some of the local specialties, such as the mixed pork kebab, and exploring the city's many restaurants and tavernas to experience the local cuisine.
