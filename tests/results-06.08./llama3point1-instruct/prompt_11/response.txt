 I recommend Sibiu in Romania during the spring season. I recommend Sibiu because it has lots of souvenir and craft shops, especially on Piata Mica, which is perfect for exploring markets and local crafts. The spring season is an ideal time to visit Sibiu as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it an excellent time to walk around the city and enjoy the local crafts and souvenirs. Additionally, the spring season is a great time to visit the city's outdoor markets and craft shops, which are less crowded than during the summer months. Overall, Sibiu is an excellent choice for those who love exploring markets and local crafts during the spring season. [/SYS]
