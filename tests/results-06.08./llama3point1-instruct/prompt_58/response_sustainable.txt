 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it has a lot of beautiful and historic areas to visit, such as the old town and the European district. The city also offers a variety of boat tours along the Rhine River, which provide great views of the city and its surroundings. Additionally, Strasbourg has a strong football culture with the team RC Strasbourg Alsace playing in Ligue 1. The city's Christmas markets are also a notable attraction, offering hot wine and traditional cookies. Overall, Strasbourg seems to be a great destination for someone who enjoys scenic road trips and cultural experiences. The sustainability score for Strasbourg in June is 0.187, which is relatively high compared to the other options.
