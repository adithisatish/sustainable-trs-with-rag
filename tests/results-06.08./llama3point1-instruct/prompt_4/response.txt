 I recommend Bordeaux as the best city for a culinary experience and wine tasting in Europe during autumn. Bordeaux is known for its rich culinary heritage and is considered the gastronomic capital of France. The city is famous for its wine, and the autumn season is an ideal time to visit, with the grape harvest taking place during this period. The city offers a wide range of wine tastings, wine bars, and wine shops, allowing visitors to sample some of the world's finest wines. Additionally, Bordeaux is home to many Michelin-starred restaurants, offering a culinary experience that is both exquisite and memorable. The city's culinary scene is a perfect blend of traditional and modern cuisine, making it an ideal destination for foodies and wine enthusiasts.
