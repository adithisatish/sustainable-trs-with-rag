 I recommend Warsaw in April. I recommend Warsaw in April because it is an ideal time to visit this city, especially for history buffs interested in World War II sites. The weather is mild and pleasant, with average highs around 15°C (59°F), making it perfect for walking and exploring the city's historical landmarks. In April, the city's famous Easter market is also in full swing, offering a unique opportunity to experience the city's culture and traditions. Additionally, the city's museums and historical sites are less crowded compared to the peak summer months, allowing for a more peaceful and immersive experience. Warsaw's Old Town, the Warsaw Uprising Museum, and the Royal Castle are just a few of the many historical sites that are a must-visit for anyone interested in World War II history. With its rich history, cultural events, and pleasant weather, Warsaw is an excellent choice for a visit in April.
