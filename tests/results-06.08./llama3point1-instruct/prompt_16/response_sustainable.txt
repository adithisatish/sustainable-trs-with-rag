 I recommend Warsaw in April because it is a city with a rich history, particularly related to World War II, with many sites and museums dedicated to this period, such as the Warsaw Uprising Museum and the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews. This makes it an ideal destination for a history buff like you. Additionally, April is a good time to visit Warsaw as the weather is mild and the city's famous spring festivals are in full swing, making it a great time to explore the city's historic sites and enjoy the local culture. The sustainability score of 0.189 for Warsaw in April is also relatively high compared to the other options, indicating a good balance between tourist attractions and environmental sustainability.
