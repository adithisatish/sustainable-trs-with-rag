 I recommend Sibiu, Romania for your spring travel. I chose Sibiu because it offers a wide variety of souvenir and craft shops, especially on Piata Mica. You can find lots of unique and authentic local products to take back home as a reminder of your trip. Additionally, Sibiu has a rich history and culture, which is reflected in its architecture, museums, and festivals. The city's sustainability score is also relatively high, making it an environmentally conscious choice for your travel. [/INST]
