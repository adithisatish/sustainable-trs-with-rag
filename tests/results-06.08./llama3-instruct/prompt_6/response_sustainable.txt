 I recommend Maastricht, Netherlands. I chose Maastricht because it is known for its beautiful city centre, rich history, and cultural attractions. The city has a high sustainability score in March, which indicates that it is a good place to visit during this time of year. Additionally, Maastricht is famous for its "joie de vivre" and offers many fine dining, arts, culture, and shopping opportunities. It is an ideal destination for someone who loves contemporary art and modern museums. The city has a variety of museums, including the Bonnefantenmuseum, which features modern and contemporary art. Overall, Maastricht is an excellent choice for someone who is interested in art, culture, and sustainability. [/INST]
