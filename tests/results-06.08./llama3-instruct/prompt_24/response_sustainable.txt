 I recommend Innsbruck, Austria. I recommend Innsbruck because it is known for its mountain climbing and adventure sports opportunities, which are perfect for a summer trip. The city is located in the heart of the Alps, offering a wide range of outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and skiing. Additionally, Innsbruck has a rich history and culture, with a mix of contemporary and imperialist architecture waiting to be discovered. The city's sustainability score is 0.265, which is relatively high compared to the other options. [/INST]
