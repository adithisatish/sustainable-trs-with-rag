 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is known for its picturesque old town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is famous for its Gothic cathedral, half-timbered houses, and charming canals. In July, the city hosts the Strasbourg Festival, which features a variety of performances, including music, dance, and theater. Additionally, the city's proximity to Germany and the Rhine River makes it an ideal destination for those interested in exploring the region. The city's Christmas markets are also a major draw, with the Strasbourg Christmas Market being one of the most famous and popular in Europe. Overall, Strasbourg is a charming and historic city that offers a unique blend of French and German culture, making it an ideal destination for travelers in July. [/INST]
