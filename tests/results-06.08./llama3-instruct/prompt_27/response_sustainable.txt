 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I chose Strasbourg because it offers a unique combination of scenic bike routes and scenic boat tours along the Rhine River. The city has an extensive bus network, making it easy to get around without a car. Additionally, Strasbourg has a rich history and culture, with many cafes and Christmas markets to explore. June is an ideal month to visit Strasbourg, with pleasant weather and long days, making it perfect for outdoor activities like cycling and boat tours.
