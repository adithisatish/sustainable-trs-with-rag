 I recommend Klagenfurt, Austria. The city offers an extensive bus network, and hiring a bicycle is a great way to explore the city and its surroundings, including the Wörthersee lake and the beach. The city also has a scenic bike route, making it an ideal destination for cycling enthusiasts. In June, the weather is usually pleasant, with mild temperatures and plenty of sunshine, making it an excellent time to visit. Klagenfurt's scenic bike routes and bike-friendly infrastructure make it an excellent choice for cyclists, and the city's proximity to the Wörthersee lake and beach adds to its charm.
