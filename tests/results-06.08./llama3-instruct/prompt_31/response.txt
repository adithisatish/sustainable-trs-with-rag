 I recommend Klagenfurt, Austria, for your scenic mountain villages trip in January. Although the city itself is not a mountain village, it offers a beautiful lake, WÃ¶rthersee, and a nearby mountainous region with many marked trails for hiking and mountain biking. The city also has a pleasant winter atmosphere, with a Christmas market and festive lights. The ideal month to visit Klagenfurt is January, which is a great time to enjoy the winter scenery and outdoor activities without the crowds.
