 I recommend Rome, Italy. As you're interested in exploring ancient Roman sites, Rome is the perfect destination for you. The city is home to numerous ancient ruins, including the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Pantheon. April is a great time to visit, with mild weather and fewer tourists compared to the peak summer months. The Roma Pass, which grants access to the first two museums and/or archaeological sites visited, is a great way to explore the city's ancient history.

The Colosseum, in particular, is a must-visit attraction. This ancient amphitheater is an engineering marvel and a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Romans. You can explore the ancient ruins, learn about the history of gladiatorial combat, and even take a guided tour to get a deeper understanding of the site.

Additionally, Rome is a city rich in history, art, and culture. You can explore numerous museums, galleries, and churches, each offering a unique glimpse into the city's past. From the Vatican City to the Castel Sant'Angelo, there's no shortage of historical landmarks to explore.

Overall, Rome is an excellent choice for anyone interested in ancient Roman history, and April is a great time to visit. I highly recommend Rome as your destination for an unforgettable experience. [/INST]
