 I recommend Strasbourg, France for your December travel. Strasbourg is a city with a rich cultural heritage and a strong tradition of folklore and local customs. The city's Christmas market, which takes place in front of the Old Town Hall, is a must-visit attraction during the holiday season. You can enjoy traditional Alsatian cuisine, such as tarte flamb√©e and bredele, while exploring the city's charming streets and historic landmarks. The city's festive atmosphere, combined with its unique blend of French and German cultures, makes it an ideal destination for experiencing local traditions and folklore during the winter season.
