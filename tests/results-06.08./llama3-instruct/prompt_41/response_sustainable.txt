 I recommend Strasbourg, France for December. I recommend it because it is a popular tourist destination, especially during the winter months, with a beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center. The city's annual winter market is a great place to experience local traditions and folklore. Additionally, the city's proximity to Germany and the European Parliament makes it an ideal destination for those interested in European politics and culture. The sustainability score for Strasbourg in December is 0.114, which is relatively high compared to the other options. [/INST]
