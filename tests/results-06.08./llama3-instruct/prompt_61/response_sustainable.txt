 I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, for experiencing local music and dance. The city hosts various festivals throughout the year, such as the Night of San Prudencio, Festival de Jazz de Vitoria-Gasteiz, and Azkena Rock Festival. The city also has a vibrant nightlife, with many bars and clubs in the medieval and Ensanche areas. Additionally, the city has a rich cultural heritage, with many museums, galleries, and historic landmarks. September is an excellent time to visit Vitoria-Gasteiz, as the weather is pleasant, and the festivals are in full swing. [/INST]
