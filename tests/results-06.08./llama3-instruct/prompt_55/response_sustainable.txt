 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is known for its historic fortresses and citadels, including the famous Strasbourg Cathedral and the medieval fortifications of the city. The city is also home to the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, which adds to its historical significance. The city's well-preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center can be explored on foot or by bicycle, making it an ideal destination for tourists. November is a great time to visit Strasbourg, as the city's winter market and festive atmosphere make it a unique and memorable experience.
