 I recommend Gaziantep, Turkey. I recommend Gaziantep because it offers a unique blend of cultural experiences, historical landmarks, and natural beauty. The city's rich history is evident in its well-preserved castle, museums, and bazaars. The narrow streets of the old town are perfect for a leisurely stroll, and the city's many parks provide a peaceful atmosphere. Additionally, Gaziantep's sustainability score in June is relatively high, indicating that it is a responsible and environmentally-friendly travel destination. Overall, Gaziantep is an excellent choice for a culturally rich and environmentally conscious travel experience. <</SYS>>[/INST]
