 I recommend Klagenfurt, Austria. As an avid hiker and nature lover, you'll appreciate the city's proximity to the WÃ¶rthersee, a beautiful lake with a cycling path that offers stunning views. The surrounding mountains are perfect for hiking, and the city itself has an extensive bus network and a charming old town that can be easily explored on foot. The summer months are ideal for hiking and outdoor activities, and Klagenfurt's warm climate makes it an excellent choice for your trip.
