 I recommend Strasbourg, France for festive activities in December. I recommend Strasbourg because it is famous for its annual winter market, which attracts tourists throughout the year, especially during the winter months. The city's pedestrian-friendly centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle, is a popular destination for tourists. The city's appeal now brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market. This information suggests that Strasbourg is an excellent choice for festive activities in December.
