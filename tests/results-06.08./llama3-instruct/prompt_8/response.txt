 I recommend Strasbourg, France. The city is known for its beautiful Gothic cathedral, the Notre-Dame de Strasbourg, and its picturesque Petite France district. In December, the city is a great destination to experience the northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis. The city's location near the Rhine River and its proximity to the French-German border make it an ideal destination for a winter getaway. The city has a rich history and culture, with many museums, galleries, and historical landmarks to explore. The city's Christmas market is also a popular attraction, with many stalls selling traditional Alsatian delicacies and crafts.

The city has a wide range of accommodations to suit all budgets, from budget-friendly hostels to luxury hotels. The city's central location makes it easy to get around, with many public transportation options available. The city's cuisine is also worth trying, with many traditional Alsatian dishes such as tarte flambée and baeckeoffe.

Overall, Strasbourg is a great destination for anyone looking to experience the magic of the northern lights, explore a rich cultural heritage, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. [/INST]
