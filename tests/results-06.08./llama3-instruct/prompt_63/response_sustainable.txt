 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I chose Strasbourg because it has a high sustainability score compared to the other options, and it offers a variety of activities and attractions, such as walking tours, boat tours, and Christmas markets. The city's old town is also a great place to explore and enjoy the local culture. Additionally, April is a good time to visit Strasbourg as the weather is mild and there are many events and festivals taking place.
