I recommend Innsbruck as the top destination for winter sports in Europe in January. Innsbruck is a city in Austria that is well known for its sporting opportunities, especially alpine sports, as it is in the Alps and surrounded by mountains. The city has a rich history and culture, with many old buildings from the Middle Ages and modern times surviving in the heart of old town. Innsbruck also hosted the 1964 and 1974 Winter Olympics and was one of the centers of snowboard boom in the 1990s. The city has a lively nightlife and is known for its eco-friendliness, with a very good public transport system and a partial ban on cars in certain areas of the historic old town. The climate in January is cold and snowy, with temperatures dropping below 10Â°C in early morning.
