I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The city is located in the south of the Basque Country and offers a unique experience for wine tasting and vineyard tours. The city is known for its beautiful architecture, rich history, and cultural heritage. The city has several wineries, including La Rioja Alavesa, where visitors can taste some of the best red wines in the world. The city is also known for its beautiful parks, gardens, and museums. The city is easily accessible by bike, bus, tram, or taxi, making it a convenient destination for travelers. Additionally, the city is located near other popular destinations such as Bilbao and San Sebastian, making it an ideal location for a romantic getaway.
