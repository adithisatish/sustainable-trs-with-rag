I recommend Strasbourg, France for trekking during summer. Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination with a beautifully preserved city center that is perfect for exploring on foot or bicycle. The city is also home to many historical sites and landmarks, such as the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights. The city is easily accessible by public transportation, including buses and trains, and there are many bike rental options available. Additionally, Strasbourg is known for its annual winter market, which attracts visitors from all over the world.
