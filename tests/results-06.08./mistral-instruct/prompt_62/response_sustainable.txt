I recommend Santander for festive activities in December. The city has a sustainability (or s-fairness) score of 0.142 in December, and it is the capital and largest city of the province of Cantabria in Spain. Santander is on the north coast, with many beaches, ferries from Britain, and a small historic center. The bars and restaurants of the old town are popular with tourists, as is El Sardinero beach a couple of kilometers away. Additionally, Santander has a rich cultural heritage, with many museums and historical landmarks to explore. The city is also known for its beautiful architecture, particularly the Santander Cathedral and the Palace of the Duchess of Aranjuez. With its mild climate and stunning scenery, Santander is the perfect destination for a festive holiday in Europe.
