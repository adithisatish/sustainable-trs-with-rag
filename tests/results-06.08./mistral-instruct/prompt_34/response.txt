I recommend visiting the Royal Palace of Stockholm, as it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a great example of 18th century Baroque architecture. You can take a guided tour of the palace, which will provide you with insight into Swedish history and culture. Additionally, you can explore the nearby parks and gardens, which offer a peaceful and scenic respite from the city.
