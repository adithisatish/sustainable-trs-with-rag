I recommend Stockholm, Sweden for your travel in Europe in spring. Stockholm is a city with great old architecture, particularly in the Old Town (Gamla Stan), which is beautifully preserved and best covered on foot. You can visit the Stockholm Palace, Storkyrkan, the cathedral of Stockholm, Riddarholmskyrkan, a beautifully preserved medieval church, and the Drottningholm palace, which is where the royal family lives. Stockholm also has several interesting churches, from medieval times to the 20th century. The Woodland cemetery, Skogskyrkogården, is one of few UNESCO World Heritage sites from the 20th century. Additionally, Stockholm has many museums, ranging from those large in size and scope to specialized museums, including the Natural History Museum, the Army Museum, the Swedish History Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Vasa Museum. Stockholm also has several viewpoints, including Fjällgatan, the Fåfängan mountain just east of Stadsgårdshamnen, and bars and restaurants such as Gondolen, Herman's, and Himlen.
