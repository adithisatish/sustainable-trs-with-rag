I recommend Strasbourg, France as the top city to visit in Europe in October for art galleries and exhibitions. The city has a rich cultural heritage and is home to many museums and art galleries, including the European Parliament, which also holds sessions in Brussels. The city is also known for its beautiful architecture, including the historic city center, which is pedestrian-friendly and can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. The city has a variety of self-guided walking tours through the town, including tours of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, Modern and Contemporary periods. Additionally, Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market.
