I recommend Sibiu, Romania. The city is known for its souvenir and craft shops, especially on Piata Mica, and has a German language book, including history and calendars, at the market square. The local beer is also available in 2Â½ L bottles. Additionally, Sibiu has a rich history and architecture, making it a great destination for exploring markets and local crafts.
