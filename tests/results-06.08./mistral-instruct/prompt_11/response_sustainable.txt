I recommend Mykolaiv in Ukraine as the best city for travel during the spring season. Mykolaiv has a rich cultural heritage, with Ukrainian theatre, Russian drama theatre, and a zoo that is one of the biggest in Europe. The city also has a museum of shipbuilding and fleet, a museum of arts, and a Lutheran Church. Additionally, Mykolaiv has a vibrant nightlife with several gorgeous parks and lots of shopping. The city is located on the Southern Bug river and has a beautiful old town with historic buildings and churches. Mykolaiv is a great place to explore markets and local crafts, and the city is known for its delicious food, especially its traditional Ukrainian dishes. Overall, Mykolaiv is an excellent destination for travelers who love exploring markets and local crafts during the spring season.
