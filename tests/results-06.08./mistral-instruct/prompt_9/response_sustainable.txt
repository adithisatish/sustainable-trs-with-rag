I recommend visiting Munich in July. Munich is a vibrant city with a rich cultural heritage and a lively music scene. In July, the city hosts several music festivals, including the Munich Summernachtstraum (Midsummer Night's Dream) and the Kocherlball. The city is also known for its surfing spots, swimming opportunities, and its many theatres, opera houses, and museums. Additionally, Munich is a hotspot for electronic music festivals, with events such as Isle of Summer, Greenfields, and Back to the Woods taking place in the area. Overall, Munich is an excellent destination for music lovers and those interested in culture and history.
