I recommend Strasbourg in France for your travel in March. Strasbourg offers a unique blend of history, culture, and outdoor activities. The city is known for its stunning architecture, charming old town, and boat tours along the Rhine. The boat tours offer a great way to explore the city and enjoy the beautiful views of both Strasbourg and neighboring Germany. Strasbourg is also home to several museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Strasbourg Museum of Decorative Arts. Additionally, the city has a vibrant nightlife scene, with many cafes and parks to explore. Overall, Strasbourg is a great destination for travelers interested in exploring caves and underground sites, as well as outdoor activities.
