I recommend visiting Sibiu in Romania in March. The city has a rich history and culture, with many interesting museums and historical landmarks to explore. The city is also known for its beautiful architecture and charming streets, making it a great place to take a stroll and enjoy the local cuisine. Additionally, Sibiu has a vibrant nightlife scene, with several gorgeous parks and shopping centers to explore.
