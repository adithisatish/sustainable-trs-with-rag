I recommend visiting Arkhangelsk in Russia in December to experience the northern lights. The city is known for its stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage, making it an ideal destination for travelers looking to immerse themselves in the local culture and explore the natural surroundings. The city is also home to several festivals, including ice sculpture festivals in winter, which provide a unique and memorable experience. Additionally, Arkhangelsk is located near severe Northern nature, rural settlements, and wooden temples, allowing travelers to explore the region's natural beauty and historical sites.
