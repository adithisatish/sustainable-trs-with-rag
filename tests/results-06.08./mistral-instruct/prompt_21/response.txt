I recommend exploring the charming villages of Maramures, Romania, instead of the city of Baia Mare. These villages offer a more authentic and picturesque experience of the region. For outdoor activities, you can go hiking and mountain biking on the hills around Baia Mare. OpenStreetMap is a reliable source for maps, GPS navigation, and trail information.
