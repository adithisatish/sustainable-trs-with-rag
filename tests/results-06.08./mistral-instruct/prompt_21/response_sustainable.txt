I recommend Strasbourg in France for exploring quaint villages and rural landscapes in Europe during the autumn. The city is a popular tourist destination with its beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. Strasbourg's appeal is not limited to the summer months and annual winter market, but it attracts tourists throughout the year. The city is also home to several cultural and historical landmarks, such as the European Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights. Additionally, Strasbourg has a variety of self-guided walking tours and bike tours available, making it an ideal destination for travelers looking to explore the region's quaint villages and rural landscapes.
