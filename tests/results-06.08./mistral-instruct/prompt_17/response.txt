I recommend visiting Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain during the Festival de Jazz de Vitoria Gasteiz in mid-July. The city offers many things to do and most are easily walkable. Visit the Old Town, take a stroll up and down the main walking street, enjoy the central park, and attend a folk/jazz music festival. The city also has a rich history and culture, with many museums and historical sites to explore. Additionally, Vitoria-Gasteiz is known for its delicious cuisine, including pintxos (small tapas dishes) and txakoli (a type of wine).
