I recommend Munich for September travel. Munich offers a vibrant cultural festival experience with events such as Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, held from mid-September to the first Sunday in October. The city is also home to numerous theatres, opera houses, and music festivals throughout the year, including the Munich Summer Festival and the Munich Film Festival. Additionally, Munich is a hotspot for electronic music festivals such as Isle of Summer, Greenfields, and Back to the Woods. With its rich cultural heritage and lively events, Munich is the perfect destination for a vibrant cultural festival experience in September.
