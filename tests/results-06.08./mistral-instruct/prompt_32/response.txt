I recommend visiting Strasbourg, France, during the summer months. It is a charming city with a rich history and culture, and there are many UNESCO World Heritage Sites to explore, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the Palace of the Dukes and Counts of Alsace. The city is also known for its beautiful architecture, including the famous Gothic Quarter and the charming streets of the Old Town. There are many museums and galleries to visit, including the Musée d'Orsay and the Musée des Beaux-Arts. The city is also home to several theaters and concert halls, where you can enjoy performances by world-renowned artists. Overall, Strasbourg is a wonderful destination for anyone interested in history, art, and culture.
