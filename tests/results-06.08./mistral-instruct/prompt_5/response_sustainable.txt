I recommend Arkhangelsk, Russia. The city has a sustainability (or s-fairness) score of 0.001 in February and offers a romantic atmosphere with cozy cafes, historic streets, and beautiful architecture. The Northern Dvina embankment is a great place to take a walk and enjoy the view of the river. The city is also known for its festivals, including ice sculpture festivals in winter and street theatres in summer. Additionally, Arkhangelsk has a rich cultural heritage, with a natural history museum, gallery of arts, and a music hall inside a former church. The city's beach is also a great place to relax in the summer, while skiing and skating are popular activities in winter. Overall, Arkhangelsk is a perfect destination for a romantic getaway in February.
