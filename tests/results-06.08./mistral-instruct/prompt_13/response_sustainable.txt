I recommend Strasbourg, France as the best destination for a family vacation in Europe in August. Strasbourg has many kid-friendly activities such as walking around the old town, boat tours along the Rhine, and visiting the Christmas markets. The city also has a rich cultural heritage with many museums, churches, and theaters. The sustainability score for Strasbourg in August is 0.409, which is considered high. Additionally, the weather in August is generally warm and sunny, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities.
