I recommend Sibiu in Romania for your travel in spring. The city is known for its rich history and architecture, including the Brukenthal National Museum, which houses a collection of over 500,000 items, including ancient artifacts, manuscripts, and artwork. Additionally, Sibiu is home to the Council Tower, which offers stunning views of the city from its observation deck. The city also has a number of beautiful parks and gardens, including the Evangelical Cathedral Park and the Brukenthal Park.
