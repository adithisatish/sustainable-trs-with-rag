I recommend visiting Strasbourg in April. Strasbourg is a beautiful city with a rich history and cultural heritage, and it is easily accessible by train or plane. The city is home to many museums, galleries, and historic landmarks, including the famous Strasbourg Cathedral, the Palais de la Musique et des Arts, and the European Parliament. The city is also known for its delicious food and wine, and there are many restaurants and cafes to choose from. Additionally, Strasbourg is a great place to explore on foot or by bike, and there are many walking and bike tours available to help you discover the city's hidden gems.
