I recommend Strasbourg in France for your honeymoon in June. The city has a beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center that can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. The appeal of Strasbourg now brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market. The city is also home to several popular tourist attractions, such as the European Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights, and the European Ombudsman. The European Audiovisual Observatory is also located in Strasbourg. Additionally, the city has a variety of self-guided walking tours through the town, as well as bike tours through the Faubourgs.
