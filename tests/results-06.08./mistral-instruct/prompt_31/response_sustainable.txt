I recommend visiting Stavanger in Norway in January. The city has a maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Winters usually mean more rain than snow in Stavanger, although going into the mountains will ensure snow. The best way to see the fantastic landscape is by hiking and climbing around the city. Many of the trails have been marked out by the Turistforetning with rocks bearing a red "T". Additionally, you can hire bicycles to travel to Klagenfurt's beach, on the shore of the WÃ¶rthersee in the Western outskirts of the city. Stavanger is an excellent destination for those looking for scenic mountain villages in Europe during the winter months.
