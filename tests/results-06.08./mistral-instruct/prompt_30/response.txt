I recommend Mykolaiv in Ukraine. Mykolaiv is a city with a rich history and culture, including a big zoo and several museums. It also has a beautiful old town and a walking trail around the city. Additionally, Mykolaiv is located near the Black Sea, which offers opportunities for birdwatching and wildlife photography.
