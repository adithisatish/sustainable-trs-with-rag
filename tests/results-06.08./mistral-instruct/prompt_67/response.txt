I recommend Paris in summer. Paris is a vibrant city with a rich cultural heritage and a thriving art scene. The city is home to many world-renowned museums and galleries, including the Louvre and the Mus√©e d'Orsay, which showcase a wide range of art from different periods. The streets of Montmartre and Le Marais are lined with independent galleries and studios, and the city is also known for its street art and graffiti. Additionally, Paris has a lively nightlife scene, with many bars, clubs, and live music venues to explore.
