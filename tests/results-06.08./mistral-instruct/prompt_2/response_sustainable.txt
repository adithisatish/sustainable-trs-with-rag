I recommend visiting Samsun, Turkey. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Samsun in June is 0.384, which is good for a summer vacation. Samsun has a beautiful beach, with Atakan Beach being particularly popular. The beach has shallow water and is suitable for children, but there is also a deeper part for more experienced swimmers. Samsun also has a vibrant nightlife, with many bars and clubs to choose from. In addition to the beach and nightlife, Samsun has a rich history and culture, with many historical sites and museums to explore. Some popular sites include the Samsun Castle, the Sarkoy Mosque, and the Atakan Beach Park. Overall, Samsun is a great destination for a summer vacation, offering a combination of relaxation, adventure, and cultural experiences.
