I recommend Copenhagen, Denmark for the best European destinations in August. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Copenhagen in August is 0.221. Copenhagen is known for its beautiful beaches, water sports, and amusement parks. In the inner harbour, water quality has improved so much that it is possible to go for a swim from early June to late August in one of the two harbour baths: Copencabana on Vesterbro or Havnebadet at Island Brygge on Amager. The municipal administration has put a lot of money and effort into the facilities and this is an excellent opportunity for blending with the locals at their best.

If you fancy a proper beach, the closest are those at Svanem√∏llen Strand, Charlottenlund Fort, and Amager Strandpark (The Lagoon), on Amager near the Lergravsparken metro station. If the weather is not going your way, you can opt for DGI Byen, a leisure centre and excellent swimming pool near the central railway station.

Copenhagen also has a lot of amusement parks, including the two oldest functioning amusement parks in the world, with the two oldest roller coasters. Bakken or Dyrehavsbakken is the older of the two, set in a beautiful beech forest near Klampenborg north of Copenhagen. Tivoli is in the city centre in a beautiful park surrounding a lake.

In terms of sports, Copenhagen has a lot to offer. Football (soccer) is very popular, with FC Copenhagen playing in Superliga, the top tier in Denmark. Cycling is also popular, with many bike paths and opportunities to rent a bike. Lifting weights is another popular activity, with Pure Gym being a great gym with day and week passes.

Copenhagen also has many annual events, including the Crafts Fair, Copenhagen Fashion Week, and CPH PIX, the Copenhagen International Film Festival. The International Workers Day is also a major event in Copenhagen, with a mix of a gigantic party and a political rally with speeches, happenings, and concerts.

Overall, Copenhagen is an excellent destination for water sports, amusement parks, sports, and annual events in August.
