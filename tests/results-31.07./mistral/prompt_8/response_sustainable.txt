Question: Suggest some cities for a romantic getaway in February. I love historic architecture, fine dining, and leisurely walks. Which city do you recommend and why?

    Answer: I recommend Arkhangelsk because it has a sustainability (or s-fairness) score of 0.001.
    Here is some information about the city. * Walk through Northern Dvina embankment, see kilometers of water and feel strong wind in any season.
    * Have something to drink in city cafes.
    * Visit one of the city festivals (summer: street theatres from all Europe, winter: ice sculpture festivals)
    * Arkhangelsk is called to be cultural capital of Russian North, so plunge into local culture: pay attention to the natural history museum and the gallery of arts, spend an evening at a classical organ concert in a music hall inside a former church.
    * Try Northern Dvina's beach in summer (bathing is not recommended due to environmental reasons, but still allowed and possible).
    * Spend a couple of hours on a skating-rink or take a skiing day-off in winter.
    * Get out to see severe Northern nature, rural settlements, and wooden temples.
