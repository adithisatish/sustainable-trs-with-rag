    Question: I'm planning a trip in the summer and I love art, history, and visiting museums. Can you suggest some European cities? Which city do you recommend and why?
    Context: Here are the options: Option 1: Craiova is a city in Romania.Here is some information about the city. Visit Art Palace. Visit Nicolae Romanescu Park. Art Museum is interesting and well worth the walk there.
    Option 2: Strasbourg is a city in France.Here is some information about the city. Strasbourg is the ninth largest city in France with nearly half a million inhabitants in a metropolitan area spanning across the river into the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Kehl]], on the eastern bank of the Rhine. The city is the seat of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Ombudsman, the Eurocorps, the European Audiovisual Observatory and, most famously, the [ European Parliament], which also holds sessions in [[Brussels]]. Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to the beautifully preserved and pedestrian friendly city centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. Don't forget that Strasbourg's appeal now brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market.

So a good way to explore it may be to get lost somewhere and enjoy what comes up, and not to always follow the guide... A good point for visitors is that most attractions will not cost you a cent: churches, ''traboules'', parks, etc. For those intending to visit several museums (which are almost the only attractions you cannot see for free), the [ Lyon City Card] may be of interest. Available from the Tourist office and some hotels, it costs €22.90 for one day, €31.90 for 2 days and €40.90 for 3 days.
