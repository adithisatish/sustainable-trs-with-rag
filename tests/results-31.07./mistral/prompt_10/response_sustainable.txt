 Here is some information about the city. * Walking around the old town is a very nice way to pass a day. And there are lots of good cafes to stop and rest in as you make your tour.
* '''Boat tours''' along the Rhine offer views over both Strasbourg and neighbouring Germany. [ Batorama] offer several river tours lasting from around 45 minutes to a few hours, costing around €10 per person. 45-min tours run around the town center and the European district.

Their home ground Stade de la Meinau (capacity 26,300) is 2 km south of town centre.
