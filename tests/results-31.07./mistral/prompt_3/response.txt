Although many foreigners have heard of spaghetti bolognais or bolognese, the dish is not a traditional dish of Bologna but a French (and subsequently British and American) adaptation, with non-Italian versions of bolognaise sauce bearing little resemblance to the local ''ragù alla bolognese''. The closest local dish is to spaghetti bolognese known as ''tagliatelle al ragù'', which uses a different type of pasta from spaghetti. Besides tagliatelle, ''ragù alla bolognese'' is also used to make ''lasagne alla bolognese''.

| contentIf you feel like picnicking on some of the cold cuts (''salumi''), cheeses and other fresh foods on display in the delicatessens and market stalls off ''Piazza Maggiore'', then ''Osteria del Sole'' at a tiny street could be a perfect venue. This traditional wine-drinkers' ''osteria'' (something of a rarity nowadays) invites you to '''bring along your own food'''. Popular with locals and travelers alike, it can get full, especially on Saturday (and don't expect to find soft drinks).
