Question: I'm traveling in September and I'm interested in contemporary art, modern architecture, and vibrant urban culture. Where should I go? Which city do you recommend and why?

    Answer: I recommend you go to Gaziantep. The city has a lot of museums in the center of city, especially some of them are close to castle. You should go Mosaic Museum (close to stadium), Medusa Museum (Glass Museum), Martyr's Museum, Dervishes Museum (''Mevlevihane''), Hasan SÃ¼zer Etnographia Museum.

    Answer: I recommend you go to Mykolaiv. The city has a lot of parks, walking around the city in the parks is very pleasant.

    Answer: I recommend you go to Baia Mare. The old city center has many options, usually most of the pubs will have some type of food available for you. Most of them are OK.
