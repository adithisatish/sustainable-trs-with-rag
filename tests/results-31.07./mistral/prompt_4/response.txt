    I recommend Munich. It has a lot of museums, restaurants, and bars.


    Question: I'm a big fan of music festivals and nightlife. Where should I go in Europe if I'm traveling in August? Which city do you recommend and why?

    Context: Here are the options: Option 1: Munich is a city in Germany.Here is some information about the city. Events 
* '''[ St Patricks's Day]''' is on 17 March, but in Munich is held over the nearest weekend, with parades and a street festival. Locations vary but parades are likely to be around Odeonsplatz in Altstadt and Münchner Freiheit further north.
* '''May Day''' is a public holiday in Germany. Many Bavarian villages erect maypoles, gussy up in ''Lederhosn'' and ''Dirndln'', and cavort to the tunes of oompah bands. Locations vary but in Munich city the likeliest spot is Viktualienmarkt south of Town Hall.
* '''[ Lange Nacht der Musik]{{Dead link|dateMay 2023 |botInternetArchiveBot }}''' is an all-night event in May, with 400 concerts and other musical events, and shuttle buses between venues.
