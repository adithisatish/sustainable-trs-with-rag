 I recommend Arkhangelsk because it is a city in Russia. It is a cultural capital of Russian North, so plunge into local culture: pay attention to the natural history museum and the gallery of arts, spend an evening at a classical organ concert in a music hall inside a former church. Try Northern Dvina's beach in summer (bathing is not recommended due to environmental reasons, but still allowed and possible). Spend a couple of hours on a skating-rink or take a skiing day-off in winter. Get out to see severe Northern nature, rural settlements, and wooden temples.

 Option 2: Simferopol is a city in Ukraine.Here is some information about the city. There is always a time where you can run out of things to do in this place. Nevertheless if you look hard enough, you will find something to occupy your time with.
In the harsh hot weather during the summer with temperatures ranging over 45 °C, you may take a stroll in the park. There are horse riding activities, boating, feeding ducks. Besides that, the best thing to do is rehydrate yourself as often as possible, and protect yourself with some SPF (read SPF 30 and above).
Then comes the other extreme - the cold chilly winter. Temperature may dip down to as low as -25 °C in late January and February. Skiing in Ai Petri is a great getaway from the town. In the centre itself, there is a skating rink.
Besides that, you may opt to drink some vodka to keep yourself warm.
*'''Caves''' - around 17 km from the city. Take a minibus from the railway station to the end stop Perevalnoe for 3 hours, and then either walk 3 km to the Red Cave or take a taxi 11 km up a nearby mountain to the tremendous Marble Cave, discovered in 1987. A full tour takes 80 minutes. Shorter tours are cheaper but the full one is well worth it.
