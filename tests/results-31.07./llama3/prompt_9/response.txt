Walk around the narrow streets of the old town: between Attatürk bd. and Eyüpoglu cd. Sit in one of the Syrian-style cafes located in adorable courtyards and enjoy a tea, a lemonade or a meal.

 Option 5: Baia Mare is a city in Romania.Here is some information about the city. The old city center has many options, usually most of the pubs will have some type of food available for you. Most of them are OK.
*'''Il Padrino''' (Strada Scolii nr. 9) – Pizzeria
*'''Restaurant Pronto''' (Strada Victoriei nr. 146) – Good and cheap traditional full meals. The restaurant is basic, but the cooks are said to be the best in town. To get there is going to be a little difficult unless you have a bike or a car, cause it is quite far from the city center.
