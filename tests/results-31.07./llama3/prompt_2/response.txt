 I recommend Copenhagen, the city of the moment, for its combination of the best of the old and the new, its vibrant nightlife, and its proximity to the beach. The city is in the midst of a renaissance. The 2009 European Capital of Culture is a city that is both a modern metropolis and a small town with a rich cultural history. It is a city where you can spend the day at the beach, the night at a concert, and the weekend at the museum. Copenhagen is also the city where you can shop at the world's most expensive store (Louis Vuitton) and where you can eat the cheapest lunch (a hot dog for €1). It is the city where you can find the world's most expensive apartment and where you can find the cheapest student room. Copenhagen is a city where you can live in the most expensive penthouse and where you can find the cheapest rental apartment. It is the city of the moment.
