 I recommend Strasbourg for its beautiful architecture and its rich cultural scene. The city is home to many museums, including the Musée d'Art Moderne et Contemporain and the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle, and is also known for its festivals, such as the Strasbourg Festival and the Strasbourg Jazz Festival. Additionally, the city is home to several theaters, such as the Théâtre National de Strasbourg and the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde. Strasbourg is also a great place for outdoor activities, with the Vosges mountains and the Black Forest nearby, and the Rhine river running through the city. Finally, the city has a rich culinary scene, with many restaurants serving traditional Alsatian cuisine and a wide variety of international cuisines.
