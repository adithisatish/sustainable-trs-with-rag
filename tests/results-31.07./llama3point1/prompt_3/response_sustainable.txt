 I recommend Bologna for its local cuisine and the fact that it is a gastronomic centre of Italy. Bologna is a city in Italy.The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Bologna in May is 0.11. 
 Here is some information about the city. There are many choices for where to eat, as Bologna is generally considered to be the gastronomic centre of Italy.

 For local dishes, try: '''Da Gianni''' in ''Via Clavature'', '''Mariposa''' in ''Via Bertiera'' or '''Meloncello''' in ''Via Sargozza''.
For good service, good wine list and fine food at a price try '''Camminetto D'Oro''' in ''Via de Falegnami'' or '''Cesarina''' in ''Piazza Santo Stefano''.
For more contemporary stylish dining try the excellent and good value '''Casa Monica''' in ''Via San Felice''.
''Via del Pratello'' has lots of bars and restaurants/osterie for young people. There's lots to choose from here. Walk past, look at the menus. It is located towards the middle of the 'western' part of the map. '''Fantoni''', with its checkered red and white table clothes and scribbled menus, is much frequented by students and serves fantastic fish secondi and an excellent ragù. ''Via Mascarella/Largo Respighi'' is another zone with a lot of osterie.
Although many foreigners have heard of spaghetti bolognais or bolognese, the dish is not a traditional dish of Bologna but a French (and subsequently British and American) adaptation, with non-Italian versions of bolognaise sauce bearing little resemblance to the local ''ragù alla bolognese''. The closest local dish is to spaghetti bolognese known as ''tagliatelle al ragù'', which uses a different type of pasta from spaghetti. Besides tagliatelle, ''ragù alla bolognese'' is also used to make ''lasagne alla bolognese''.

| contentIf you feel like picnicking on some of the cold cuts (''salumi''), cheeses and other fresh foods on display in the delicatessens and market stalls off ''Piazza Maggiore'', then ''Osteria del Sole'' at a tiny street could be a perfect venue. This traditional wine-drinkers' ''osteria'' (something of a rarity nowadays) invites you to '''bring along your own food'''. Popular with locals and travelers alike, it can get full, especially on Saturday (and don't expect to find soft drinks).
