# Analysis - Questions 

1. Given the same prompts and context, do both models recommend the same city/cities? 
2. Out of all the cities recommended (for all the prompts), how many were not in the 160 cities? And how does this vary for Llama3.1 and Mistral? => indicative of how much the models have hallucinated 
3. Is the sustainability score being understood and considered in the ranking? How often does each model recommend the city with the lowest sustainability score as its top choice? 
4. How similar are the explanations for the recommended cities to their respective contexts? 
5. How good of an answer is the LLM response to the user query? => evaluated with LLM-as-a-Judge, approximation of human evaluation
