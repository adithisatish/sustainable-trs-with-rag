 I recommend Innsbruck, Austria as the best city for mountain climbing and adventure sports in Europe during summer. Innsbruck is a city surrounded by the beautiful Austrian Alps, offering a wide range of outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, and skiing. The city has a well-developed infrastructure for adventure sports, with numerous ski resorts, including the Nordpark, which offers several ski routes in winter, and the Patscherkofelbahn, which is a popular skiing region with a variety of challenging terrain. Additionally, the city has a range of indoor activities, such as escape rooms and a casino, for those who prefer to gamble in a more glamorous environment. The summer season in Innsbruck is ideal for outdoor activities, with pleasant weather and a range of festivals and events, including the Air & Style Snowboard Contest and the Sound City festival. Overall, Innsbruck offers an excellent combination of outdoor and indoor activities, making it an ideal destination for mountain climbing and adventure sports enthusiasts.
