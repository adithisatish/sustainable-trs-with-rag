 I recommend Copenhagen for June. Copenhagen is an excellent choice for June, with pleasant weather and a variety of activities to enjoy. The city's beaches, such as Copencabana and Havnebadet, are open from early June to late August, making it an ideal time to soak up the sun and enjoy water activities. Additionally, the city hosts the CPH Distortion festival in the first week of June, which is a wild party with over 60 parties in five days, making it a great time to experience the city's vibrant nightlife. The average high temperature in June is around 18°C (64°F), making it a comfortable time to explore the city's many attractions, such as the amusement parks, museums, and historic sites. Overall, Copenhagen is a great destination for a summer vacation in June. [/INST]
