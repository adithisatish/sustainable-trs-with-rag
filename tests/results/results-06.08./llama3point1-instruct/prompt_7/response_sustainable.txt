 I recommend Nalchik as the best destination for trekking in Europe during summer. I recommend Nalchik because it offers a variety of hiking trails with breathtaking views, including the Bezengi valley and Chegem valley, which are a 1-hour drive from the city. The trails are not as crowded as in other popular destinations, and you can explore the beautiful scenery and flora without the tourist crowds. Additionally, the city has a rich cultural heritage, with the Central Park of Culture and Recreation offering artificial lakes, an amusement park, and paddle-boat rental. The city also has a unique horse-riding experience, with the opportunity to rent pure-breed competition horses or take a ride in the nature on a quieter animal. Overall, Nalchik provides a perfect blend of adventure, culture, and natural beauty, making it an ideal destination for trekking in Europe during summer.
