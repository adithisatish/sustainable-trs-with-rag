 I recommend Strasbourg as the best destination for trekking in Europe during summer. Strasbourg is a great city for hiking and offers a variety of trails for all levels, from easy walks around the old town to more challenging hikes in the nearby mountains. The city's scenic location on the Rhine River and its picturesque surroundings make it an ideal place for nature lovers and hikers. Additionally, the city's mild summer climate and the availability of boat tours along the Rhine offer a pleasant experience for visitors. While other cities like Varna, Klagenfurt, and Nalchik may have some hiking opportunities, Strasbourg's unique combination of urban and natural attractions makes it the best choice for a summer trekking experience.
