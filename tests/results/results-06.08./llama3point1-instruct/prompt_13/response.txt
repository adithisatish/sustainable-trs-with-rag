 I recommend Thessaloniki in Greece for a family vacation in August. Thessaloniki is a lively city in Northern Greece with a wide range of kid-friendly activities and attractions. In the summer, the city's beaches and water activities are perfect for families, and the city's many parks and gardens offer a cool escape from the heat. The city also hosts various festivals and events in August, such as the International Workers' Day celebrations, which are fun for the whole family. Additionally, the city's many museums and historical sites are great for kids to learn about history and culture. Overall, Thessaloniki is an excellent choice for a family vacation in August. 

Note: The other options mentioned in the context do not provide enough information to determine the best destination for a family vacation in August. Mykolaiv is a city in Ukraine with a rich history and cultural attractions, but it may not be the best fit for a family vacation in August. Strasbourg is a city in France with a rich history and cultural attractions, but it may not have as many kid-friendly activities as Thessaloniki. Varna is a city in Bulgaria with a beautiful beach and a lively nightlife, but it may not have as many family-friendly activities as Thessaloniki.

Malatya is a city in Turkey with a rich history and cultural attractions, but it may not have as many kid-friendly activities as Thessaloniki.
