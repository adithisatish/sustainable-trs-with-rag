 I recommend Strasbourg, France because it is a popular tourist destination, and its city centre is beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly, making it ideal for exploring on foot or by bicycle, especially during the spring season. The city's appeal is a great draw for tourists throughout the year, including the spring months. The Tourist Office in the city centre offers self-guided walking tours and bike tours, which would be a great way to discover the city's history and architecture during your visit.
