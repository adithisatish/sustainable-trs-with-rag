 I recommend Maastricht. Maastricht is the best city to visit in March because it offers a "Burgundian" way of life, fine dining, arts, culture, and shopping opportunities, which are perfect for the spring season. The city's scenic views along the river Maas and historic buildings make it an ideal destination for tourists. Additionally, Maastricht has a high sustainability score of 0.163 in March, indicating that it is a responsible and environmentally friendly city. This makes it an excellent choice for travelers who value sustainability.
