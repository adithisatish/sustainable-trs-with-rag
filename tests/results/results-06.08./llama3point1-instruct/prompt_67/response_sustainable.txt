 I recommend Paris. I recommend Paris because it is known for its vibrant street art and graffiti, especially during the summer months. The city has a rich history of artistic expression, and its streets are filled with beautiful murals and graffiti. Additionally, Paris is a popular tourist destination, and its art scene is thriving, making it an ideal place to experience vibrant street art and graffiti in the summer.

 Option 2: Strasbourg is a city in France.The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Strasbourg in Jul is 0.188. 
 Here is some information about the city. Strasbourg is the ninth largest city in France with nearly half a million inhabitants in a metropolitan area spanning across the river into the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Kehl]], on the eastern bank of the Rhine.
The city is the seat of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Ombudsman, the Eurocorps, the European Audiovisual Observatory and, most famously, the [ European Parliament], which also holds sessions in [[Brussels]].
Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to the beautifully preserved and pedestrian friendly city centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days.
