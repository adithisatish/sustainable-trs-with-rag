 I recommend Thessaloniki, Greece for the city with the most vibrant nightlife in Europe in September. Thessaloniki is known for its lively atmosphere, especially in the old city and the seafront, with many bars, tavernas, and clubs playing a variety of music, from traditional Greek bouzoukia to alternative and ethnic music. The city has a long beach promenade with many bars and cafes, and the famous White Tower area is a popular spot for nightlife. In September, the weather is warm and pleasant, making it an ideal time to enjoy the city's nightlife. The city's bars and clubs are open late, and the atmosphere is lively and festive. I recommend Thessaloniki because it offers a unique and exciting experience, with a mix of traditional and modern elements, and a vibrant atmosphere that is sure to keep you entertained.
