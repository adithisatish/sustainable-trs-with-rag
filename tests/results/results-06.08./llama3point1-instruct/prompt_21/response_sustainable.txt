I recommend Strasbourg for your travel in the autumn. Strasbourg is a charming city with a well-preserved and pedestrian-friendly city centre that is perfect for exploring on foot or by bike. The autumn season is ideal for visiting Strasbourg, with comfortable temperatures and a festive atmosphere, especially during the annual winter market. The city's unique blend of French and German cultures, along with its rich history and beautiful architecture, will make your visit a memorable experience. Additionally, the city's sustainability score is relatively high compared to the other options, making it a responsible choice for your travel.
