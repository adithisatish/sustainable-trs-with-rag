 I recommend Sibiu, Romania, in July. I recommend Sibiu because it has lots of souvenir and craft shops, especially on Piata Mica, which matches the user's interest in historic marketplaces and bazaars. The ideal month of travel is July, as the sustainability score for Sibiu in July is 0.397, which is relatively high compared to the other options.
