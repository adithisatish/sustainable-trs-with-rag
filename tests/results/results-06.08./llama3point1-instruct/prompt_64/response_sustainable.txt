 I recommend Strasbourg. I recommend Strasbourg because it is a city with a beautiful historical centre, the Grande Île, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although it is not specified in the question, I will recommend the ideal month to visit Strasbourg, which is June. This is because June offers pleasant weather with average highs around 22°C (72°F), ideal for exploring the city's historical centre and enjoying the city's famous Christmas market in December, but the weather is perfect in June. Additionally, the city hosts the Strasbourg Festival in June, which features a variety of cultural events and music performances.
