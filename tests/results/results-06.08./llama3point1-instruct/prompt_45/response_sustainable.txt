 I recommend Strasbourg, France, in June. I recommend Strasbourg because it is a beautiful city with a well-preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center that can be explored on foot or by bicycle in a few days. The city is a popular tourist destination, especially during the summer months, with large tour groups. Additionally, Strasbourg hosts the European Parliament and has a rich history, making it an ideal destination for couples celebrating their honeymoon. The ideal month of travel for Strasbourg is June, which is a great time to visit the city due to the pleasant weather and the annual summer months tourist season.
