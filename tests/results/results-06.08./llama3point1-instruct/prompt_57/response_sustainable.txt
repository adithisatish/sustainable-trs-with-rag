 I recommend Munich. I recommend Munich because it offers a variety of festivals and events throughout the year, particularly in the spring. In April, Munich hosts the May Day celebrations, which include parades and a street festival. The city also hosts the Lange Nacht der Musik event in May, featuring 400 concerts and other musical events. Additionally, Munich's spring season offers the Corso Leopold street fair, which takes place in June and September. The city's festive atmosphere and rich cultural events make it an ideal destination for someone who loves experiencing local festivals and celebrations.
