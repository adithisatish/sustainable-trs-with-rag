 I recommend Copenhagen in November. I recommend Copenhagen in November because the city's history is rich and varied, with a mix of Viking, medieval, and modern influences. In November, the weather is generally cool and rainy, which makes it an ideal time to explore the city's many museums and historical sites without the crowds. The city's famous Christmas markets and festive atmosphere also make it a great time to visit. Additionally, November is a good time to learn about Viking history, as it is a period of great significance in Copenhagen's history, and the city's museums and historical sites offer a wealth of information and insights into this period. The ideal month to visit Copenhagen for Viking history is November.
