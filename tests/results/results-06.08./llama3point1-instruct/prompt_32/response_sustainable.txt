 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is famous for its beautiful historical centre - the Grande ÃŽle - which was the first city centre to be classified entirely as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This makes it a perfect destination for someone interested in UNESCO World Heritage sites. Additionally, visiting in June, the summer month mentioned in the question, allows you to enjoy the city's pleasant weather and the many outdoor events and festivals that take place during this time.
