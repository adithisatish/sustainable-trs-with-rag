 I recommend Strasbourg. I recommend Strasbourg because it is known for its beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. The city also hosts an annual winter market, which is a perfect fit for a Christmas holiday. Its sustainability score in December is 0.114, which is relatively high. This makes it an ideal destination for a festive holiday in December.
