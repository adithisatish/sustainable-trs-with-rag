 I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, in February. I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz because it is located in the La Rioja Alavesa region, where you can taste some of the best red wines of the world. In February, the weather is generally mild and pleasant, making it an ideal time to visit the vineyards and enjoy wine tastings. Additionally, the city is small and can be easily explored on foot, which is convenient during the winter months. The city's wine tours and tastings are a great way to spend a romantic getaway, and the local wine is a perfect accompaniment to a romantic evening.
