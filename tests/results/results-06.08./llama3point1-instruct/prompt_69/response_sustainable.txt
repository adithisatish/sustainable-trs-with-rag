 I recommend Munich, Germany. I recommend Munich because it has a variety of cultural heritage and folk music events in June. For example, the Christopher Street Day, a Rainbow Pride or LGBTQ+ event, is held over two weeks in June, and the Tollwood music festival is organized in Olympic Park in June. These events showcase the city's rich cultural scene and its commitment to inclusivity and diversity. Additionally, Munich's sustainability score of 0.126 in June is relatively high, indicating a strong focus on environmental sustainability. Overall, Munich appears to be an excellent choice for someone interested in cultural heritage and folk music in June.
