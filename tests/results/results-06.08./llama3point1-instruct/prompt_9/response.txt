 I recommend Munich as the best European city to visit in July for music festivals and nightlife. The city offers a variety of events and festivals that cater to different tastes and preferences. In July, you can enjoy the "MÃ¼nchner Sommernachtstraum" (Midsummer Night's Dream) music festival with fireworks on Olympiapark, the "Kocherlball" (Cooks' Ball) held by the Chinese Tower in the English Garden, and the "Impark" festival, which is a mixture of fairground, live music, and sports events. Additionally, the city's nightlife scene is vibrant, with many bars, clubs, and pubs to choose from, particularly in the areas of Cuchi, Zapa, and Pinto. Overall, Munich provides an ideal setting for a fun and lively experience in July.
