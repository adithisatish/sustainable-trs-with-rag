 I recommend Naples, Italy for your scenic coastal towns and fresh seafood. Naples is famous for its delicious seafood dishes, and the best time to visit is in May when the weather is pleasant and the seafood is at its freshest. You can enjoy a variety of seafood options, such as fresh fish, seafood risotto, and seafood pizza, at the many restaurants in the city. The city's Seafood Festival in July is also a great time to visit, but May is an excellent time to experience the city's seafood culture without the crowds. Additionally, Naples has a rich history, stunning architecture, and a vibrant cultural scene, making it an excellent choice for a scenic coastal town getaway. [/SYS]
