 I recommend Van, Turkey, because it offers the best opportunity for birdwatching and wildlife photography in April. With a sustainability score of 0.187, it is a good option for those interested in nature and the environment. Lake Erçek is an important site for migrating waterbirds, with about 180 species, including several endangered ones, making it an ideal location for birdwatching. The nearby beaches and scenic landscapes also provide opportunities for wildlife photography. [/SYS]
