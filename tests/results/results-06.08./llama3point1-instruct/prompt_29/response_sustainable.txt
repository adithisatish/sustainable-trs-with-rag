 I recommend Strasbourg in France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is a beautiful and historic city with a lot of tourist attractions, including the European Parliament and the beautifully preserved city centre. Additionally, it is a popular tourist destination, which means it is likely to have a lively atmosphere and plenty of romantic activities to enjoy in November. The sustainability score is not the highest, but the city's romantic and festive atmosphere in November makes it an ideal choice for an anniversary trip.

<|reserved_special_token_85|><|reserved_special_token_164|>The provided context does not have the answer.  The context only contains information about cities in Ukraine, France, and Romania, but does not provide information about other cities in Europe that might be suitable for a romantic anniversary trip. If you provide more information about other European cities, I can help you with the recommendation.
