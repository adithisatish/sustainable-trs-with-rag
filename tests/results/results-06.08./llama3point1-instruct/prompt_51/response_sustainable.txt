 I recommend Strasbourg. I recommend Strasbourg because it is a beautiful city with a well-preserved and pedestrian-friendly city centre that can be explored on foot or by bicycle in a few days. It is also a popular tourist destination, especially during the summer months, with many attractions such as the European Parliament, the Strasbourg Cathedral, and the Petite France district. Additionally, the city has a good sustainability score of 0.409, which suggests that it is a responsible and environmentally friendly destination. Overall, Strasbourg seems to be a great choice for someone interested in architecture and design.
