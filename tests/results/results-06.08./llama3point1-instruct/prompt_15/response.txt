 I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz because it is located in the La Rioja Alavesa region, which is known for its excellent red wines, and there are many touristic tours available to explore the local vineyards and wine culture. Additionally, the city is small and easy to navigate on foot, making it an ideal destination for a wine-themed trip. The ideal month to visit Vitoria-Gasteiz for wine tours is September, as the weather is pleasant and the grape harvest season is in full swing, making it an excellent time to experience the local wine culture.
