 I recommend Copenhagen as the top destination in Europe for picturesque coastal villages in summer. Copenhagen is a great city for visiting in summer due to its beautiful beaches, amusement parks, and vibrant atmosphere. The city has two of the oldest functioning amusement parks in the world, Bakken and Tivoli, which are perfect for a summer day out. Additionally, the city's harbour baths, Copencabana and Havnebadet, are ideal for swimming and sunbathing from early June to late August. The city's picturesque coastline and numerous parks, such as Amager Strandpark and Charlottenlund Fort, offer a serene and idyllic atmosphere, making it an ideal destination for a summer visit. [/SYS]
