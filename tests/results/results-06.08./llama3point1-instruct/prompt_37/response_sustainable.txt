 I recommend Strasbourg in France. I recommend Strasbourg because it offers a mix of beautiful city centre and historic architecture, which can be explored on foot or by bicycle, making it an ideal destination for scenic train rides and scenic views. The city is also a popular tourist destination, and its pedestrian-friendly centre can be easily explored in a few days. Additionally, Strasbourg is a seat of the European Parliament and has a rich history, which adds to its charm. The ideal month to visit Strasbourg is May, which is a good time to enjoy the beautiful spring weather and scenic views.
