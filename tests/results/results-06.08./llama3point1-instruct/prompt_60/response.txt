 I recommend Bologna and why I recommended it: Bologna is a historic city in Italy that is home to the oldest university in continental Europe, founded in 1088. It is known for its well-preserved historic center, rich cultural heritage, and vibrant atmosphere, making it an ideal destination for those interested in historic universities and academic towns. Since you are traveling in May, the weather is warm and pleasant, with mild temperatures and plenty of sunshine, making it an excellent time to visit Bologna. Its rich history, stunning architecture, and lively cultural scene make it an excellent choice for your trip.
