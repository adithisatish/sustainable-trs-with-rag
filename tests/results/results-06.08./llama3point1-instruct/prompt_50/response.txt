 I recommend Copenhagen as the best destination in Europe for scenic lakes and boat rides in July. The city has many beautiful lakes and a lake in the middle of the city, and it offers a variety of boat tours and rentals. The weather is usually warm and sunny in July, making it an ideal time to enjoy the city's lakes and water activities. Copenhagen's lakes are a popular spot for swimming, sunbathing, and picnics, and the city also has many parks and gardens that offer a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Additionally, the city's many boat tours and rentals allow visitors to explore the city's waterways and enjoy the scenic views of the city from the water. Copenhagen is a great destination for those who love lakes and boat rides, and July is an ideal time to visit.
