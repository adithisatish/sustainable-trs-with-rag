 I recommend Amsterdam for you because it offers a variety of parks and botanical gardens to explore, such as the Vondelpark, the Hortus Botanicus, and Amsterdamse Bos, which are perfect for a spring visit. The city's pleasant weather and blooming flowers make it an ideal destination for enjoying the outdoors during this season. Additionally, Amsterdam's many parks and gardens are well-maintained and offer a serene escape from the city's bustle. The city also has a variety of events and festivals in the spring, such as the King's Day celebrations, which showcase the city's vibrant atmosphere. Overall, Amsterdam's unique blend of natural beauty, cultural events, and outdoor activities make it the perfect destination for your spring visit. The provided context does not have the information about the sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Plovdiv in May.
