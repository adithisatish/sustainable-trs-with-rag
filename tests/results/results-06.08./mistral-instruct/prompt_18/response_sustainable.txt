I recommend visiting Strasbourg, France during December as it is known for its beautiful Christmas markets. The city has several markets, including the famous Christmas Market in Place Kl√©ber, which is known for its traditional French food and drink. Other markets include the Alsatian Christmas Market in Place Gutenberg and the Christmas Market in the historic center of the city. Strasbourg is also known for its beautiful architecture and rich history, making it a great destination for travelers who are interested in exploring both the cultural and historical aspects of Europe.
