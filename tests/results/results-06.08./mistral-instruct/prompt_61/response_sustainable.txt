I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The city is known for its festivals, which include the Night of 27 April and day of 28 April, the Mid July Festival de Jazz de Vitoria Gasteiz, the 4th August till 9th August Fiesta de La Blanca, and the June Azkena Rock Festival. The city center is also a popular place to visit, with early night options including Plaza Virgen Blanca, Calle Dato, and Calle Postas, and later night options including the Medieval Area and the Ensanche Area. Vitoria-Gasteiz also has a rich history and culture, with many museums, theaters, and other cultural attractions to explore.
