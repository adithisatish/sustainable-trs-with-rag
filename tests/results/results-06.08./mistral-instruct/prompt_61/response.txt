I recommend visiting Varna in September, as it will be a great time to explore the city and enjoy the local music scene. The city is known for its vibrant nightlife, and there are many clubs and bars that offer live music and dancing. Some popular venues include Cubo, Horizont, and Planet Club. Additionally, there are many street performers and musicians throughout the city that you can enjoy.
