I recommend Sibiu in Romania for December. The city is a great place to experience local traditions and folklore. Sibiu is known for its rich history and beautiful architecture, including the Council Tower, the Brukenthal National Museum, and the Evangelical Cathedral. The city also has a lively nightlife scene, with several bars, clubs, and live music venues. Additionally, Sibiu is home to several festivals and events throughout the year, including the Christmas Market, which is a great place to find unique gifts and souvenirs. Overall, Sibiu is a perfect destination for travelers who want to experience local traditions and folklore in Europe.
