I recommend Sibiu for your trip in October. Sibiu has a rich history and culture, with a mix of German and Romanian influences. The city is known for its stunning architecture, including the Brukenthal National Museum, which houses a vast collection of art and artifacts from Romania and beyond. Additionally, Sibiu is home to the State Philharmonic of Sibiu, which offers regular concerts featuring some of the finest musicians in the region. With its many souvenir and craft shops, especially on Piata Mica, Sibiu is a great place to pick up unique gifts and mementos. Overall, Sibiu is a fantastic destination for anyone interested in art, literature, and history.
