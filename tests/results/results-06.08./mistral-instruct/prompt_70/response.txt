I recommend visiting Thessaloniki, Greece in July. The city is known for its historic marketplaces and bazaars, such as Tsimiski, Proxenou Koromila, and Mitropoleos. You can also find a variety of books, maps, and local food products at stores like Ianos bookshop and Modiano market. The city's traditional central food market, with hundreds of stalls selling meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, clothes, flowers, herbs, and spices, is a must-see. Additionally, Thessaloniki is famous for its nightlife, with many bars and cafes to explore.
