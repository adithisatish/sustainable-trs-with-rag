I recommend Cagliari in Italy for your travel in July. Cagliari is a city known for its historic marketplaces and bazaars, such as the famous Piazza Yuri Gagarin and the Mercato delle Erbe. Additionally, Cagliari offers a vibrant cultural scene, with a rich history and beautiful architecture. The city's location on the island of Sardinia also offers opportunities for exploring the local beaches and natural landscapes. While the sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Cagliari in July is 0.354, the city's ideal month of travel is typically in the spring or fall, when the weather is mild and comfortable.
