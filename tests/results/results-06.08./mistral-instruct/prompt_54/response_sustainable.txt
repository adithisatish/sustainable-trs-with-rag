I recommend Innsbruck as the best destination in Europe for relaxation in hot springs and spa resorts in winter. The city offers a mix of contemporary and imperialist history, culture, and architecture, and is a hub for skiing and other mountain-related activities. The popularity of Innsbruck as a winter sports resort was underscored by its hosting the Winter Olympic Games twice. Additionally, the city offers a variety of architectural styles waiting to be discovered in every street. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Innsbruck in January is 0.037, making it a great option for eco-conscious travelers.
