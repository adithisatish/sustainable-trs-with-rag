I recommend visiting Munich, Germany during spring. The city is known for its festivals and celebrations, and there are several events taking place during this time of year. St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17th, with parades and a street festival held over the nearest weekend. May Day is a public holiday in Germany, with many Bavarian villages erecting maypoles and cavorting to the tunes of oompah bands. The Lange Nacht der Musik is an all-night event in May, with 400 concerts and other musical events, and shuttle buses between venues. Tollwood organizes two extended music festivals in June and November, and Corso Leopold is a street fair taking over a km of Leopoldstra√üe in June. The Theatron Pfingsfestival is a music festival in June, with the stage on a platform on the lake. Christopher Street Day is a Rainbow Pride or LGBTQ+ event held over two weeks in June. Additionally, the Munich Summernachtstraum is a music festival with fireworks on July 15th. Overall, Munich is a great destination for festival lovers during spring.
