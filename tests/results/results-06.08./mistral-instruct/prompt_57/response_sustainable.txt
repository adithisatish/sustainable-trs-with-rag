I recommend Munich as the top destination in Europe for spring. Munich is a city in Germany that offers a variety of festivals and celebrations throughout the year, but especially during the spring months. In March, St. Patrick's Day is celebrated with parades and a street festival, and in May, Germany celebrates May Day with maypoles, Lederhosen, and Dirndln. Additionally, Munich hosts the Lange Nacht der Musik, an all-night music festival in May, as well as two extended music festivals, Tollwood and Corso Leopold, in June. The city also has a rich history and culture, with many theatres, museums, and landmarks to explore.
