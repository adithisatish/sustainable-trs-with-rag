I recommend Strasbourg in France for the month of November. Strasbourg is a historic city with beautifully preserved fortresses and citadels, including the Old Bridge and the Vauban Fortress. It is also the seat of several important international organizations, including the European Parliament. The city is pedestrian-friendly and offers a variety of self-guided walking tours, bike tours, and other activities to explore. The weather in November is generally mild, with temperatures ranging from 7째C to 12째C (45째F to 54째F), making it a great time to explore the city's attractions.
