I recommend visiting Munich, Germany during May as it is the month of the Munich International Film Festival. The festival features a variety of films and workshops, and is a great opportunity to explore the city's rich cultural heritage. Additionally, Munich is known for its festivals, such as Oktoberfest, which takes place in September.
