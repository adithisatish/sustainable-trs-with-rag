I recommend visiting Innsbruck, Austria. It is a beautiful city with a lot to offer for travelers. In the summer, you can go hiking, biking, or swimming at the nearby lake. There are also many museums and cultural attractions to visit, such as the historic old town and the stunning Alps. Additionally, Innsbruck is known for its winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding.
