I recommend Mykolaiv in Ukraine during summer for mountain climbing and adventure sports. Mykolaiv offers a variety of options for outdoor activities, including hiking, camping, and rock climbing. The city is also home to several museums and cultural attractions, such as the Museum of Shipbuilding and Fleet and the Museum of Arts. Additionally, Mykolaiv has a zoo, which is one of the largest in Europe and a great place to see animals up close. The city's location near the Black Sea also offers opportunities for water sports and beach activities.
