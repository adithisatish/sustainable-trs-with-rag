I recommend visiting Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain in September. The city is known for its wine and vineyards, and the month of September is a great time to visit as it is the peak season for wine festivals. The city is small and easily walkable, making it a great place to explore on foot. You can also rent a bike or take a tram or bus to get around. Some popular wineries to visit include Bodegas Baigorri and Bodegas Muga. Additionally, you can take a wine tour to visit other wineries in the region.
