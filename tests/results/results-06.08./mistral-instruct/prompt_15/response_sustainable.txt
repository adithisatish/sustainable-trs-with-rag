I recommend Bordeaux in France for travel in September. Bordeaux is a city that offers an unparalleled wine experience, with a variety of vineyards and wineries to visit. The city is home to some of the world's most famous wines, and the appellation system (AOC) can be bewildering, but there are many tours and tastings available to help you navigate the vineyards and learn about the different wines. Bordeaux is also a vibrant city with plenty of other attractions, including museums, sports, and more.
