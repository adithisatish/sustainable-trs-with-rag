I recommend Munich, Germany for your travel in June. Munich offers a variety of scenic road trips through beautiful landscapes, including the Bavarian Alps and the picturesque towns of the Bavarian countryside. The city is also known for its rich history and culture, with many museums, theatres, and historical landmarks to explore. Additionally, Munich is home to the famous Oktoberfest festival, which takes place in September and is a must-see event for many visitors.
