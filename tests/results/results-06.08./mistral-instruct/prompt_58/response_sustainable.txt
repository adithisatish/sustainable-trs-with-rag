I recommend Strasbourg in France for your scenic road trip in June. The city offers a combination of beautiful landscapes and cultural experiences, making it an ideal destination for travelers who enjoy both. Strasbourg is known for its stunning architecture, charming old town, and boat tours along the Rhine river. The city is also home to several museums, including the Museum of Shipbuilding and Fleet, and the Astronomical Observatory. Additionally, Strasbourg is known for its Christmas markets, which are held throughout the year, and are particularly beautiful during the holiday season. With its rich history, culture, and natural beauty, Strasbourg is an excellent choice for a scenic road trip in Europe.
