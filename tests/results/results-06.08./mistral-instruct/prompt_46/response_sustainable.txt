I recommend Strasbourg as the top city to visit in Europe in November. Strasbourg is a beautiful city with a rich history and culture, and it's perfect for art lovers and history buffs. The city is home to many museums and galleries, including the Musée d'Orsay, which houses an impressive collection of Impressionist art. Additionally, Strasbourg is known for its stunning architecture, particularly its Gothic cathedrals and historic buildings.

Another reason to visit Strasbourg in November is the Christmas Markets. Strasbourg is famous for its Christmas Markets, which are held in many places throughout the city, including the beautiful Place de la Cathédrale and Place Broglie. These markets offer a wide range of festive food and drinks, including hot wine and Christmas cookies.

Overall, Strasbourg is the perfect destination for art lovers and history buffs looking for a cultural experience in Europe.
