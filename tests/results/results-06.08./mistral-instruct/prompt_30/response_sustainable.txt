I recommend Strasbourg, France for your travel in April. The city's sustainability (or s-fairness) score for April is 0.229, making it an ideal destination for birdwatching and wildlife photography. Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination with a beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center that can be explored on foot or by bicycle. The city is also home to several parks and shopping districts, making it the perfect place to spend a few days exploring. Additionally, Strasbourg is the seat of several international organizations, including the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, and the European Parliament, making it a unique cultural and historical destination.
