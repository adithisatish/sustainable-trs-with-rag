1. Visit the Vondelpark: This beautiful park is a great place to enjoy the spring weather and see the city's famous windmills.
2. Explore the city's museums: Amsterdam is home to many world-class museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Anne Frank House.
3. Take a canal cruise: Amsterdam is famous for its canals, and taking a boat tour is a great way to see the city from a different perspective.
4. Visit the Artis Zoo: This zoo is home to a wide variety of animals, including lions, tigers, and giraffes.
5. Try some local food: Amsterdam is known for its delicious food, including stroopwafels, bitterballen, and herring.
