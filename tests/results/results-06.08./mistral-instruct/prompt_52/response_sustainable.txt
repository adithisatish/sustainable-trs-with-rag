I recommend Copenhagen, Denmark. Copenhagen is a beautiful city with a lot to offer for travelers. In the summer, you can enjoy the beach at the inner harbor or visit one of the many amusement parks, such as Bakken or Tivoli. The city also has a rich cultural scene, with many museums, theaters, and music festivals to explore. Additionally, Copenhagen is known for its sustainable and eco-friendly practices, making it a great destination for those who care about the environment.
