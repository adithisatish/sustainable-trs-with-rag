I recommend Strasbourg, France. Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to its beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. The city is the seat of several international organizations, including the European Parliament, and is known for its rich history and cultural heritage. Strasbourg is also famous for its Christmas market, which attracts visitors from around the world.
