I recommend Plovdiv, Bulgaria as the top destination in Europe for January. Plovdiv is known for its colorful past and has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The city's stunning architecture, a mix of modern and traditional, is a sight to behold. Additionally, Plovdiv's location makes it an ideal destination for exploring Bulgaria's beautiful countryside. The city was also the European Capital of Culture for 2019, which means that it has undergone significant renovations and improvements, making it an even more enjoyable destination to visit.
