I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz as it offers a combination of outdoor activities and cultural experiences. The city is located in the Basque Country, which is known for its beautiful scenery and outdoor pursuits. Vitoria-Gasteiz itself is a small city, but there are plenty of opportunities to explore the surrounding areas on foot or by bike. The city also has a rich cultural heritage, with many museums, galleries, and theaters to explore. Additionally, there are several boat tours available along the Rhine River, offering views of both Vitoria-Gasteiz and neighboring Germany.
