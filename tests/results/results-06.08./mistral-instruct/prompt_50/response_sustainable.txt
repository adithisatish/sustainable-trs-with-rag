I recommend Stockholm, Sweden as the best destination for boat rides and water activities in July. Stockholm is known for its beautiful archipelago with 24,000 islands, lakes, and streams. You can enjoy boat tours, kayaking, and swimming in the fresh water. The city also offers a variety of water sports such as windsurfing, kiteboarding, and paddleboarding. Additionally, Stockholm is a hub for most Swedish rail and bus traffic, with two of the country's busiest airports nearby.
