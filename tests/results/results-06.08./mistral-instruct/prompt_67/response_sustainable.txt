I recommend Paris in France for experiencing vibrant street art and graffiti in summer. The city has a rich history and culture, and it is known for its beautiful architecture, art, and fashion. Paris has numerous museums, galleries, and street art exhibitions, including the Mus√©e d'Orsay, which houses the largest collection of Impressionist art in the world. Additionally, the city is known for its vibrant nightlife and is home to many street artists and graffiti writers who create stunning murals and artworks throughout the city. Paris is also a popular international tourist destination, with around 14 million tourists annually, making it an ideal place to explore and experience vibrant street art and graffiti.
