I recommend Strasbourg as the best city to travel to in Europe in April for exploring national parks and protected areas. Strasbourg is a beautiful city with a lot to offer, including boat tours along the Rhine, which offer views over both Strasbourg and neighboring Germany. The city is also home to several museums and historical landmarks, including the Museum of Shipbuilding and Fleet and the Russian Orthodox Church. Additionally, Strasbourg is known for its Christmas markets, which are some of the most beautiful and important in Europe. With its rich history, cultural heritage, and stunning natural beauty, Strasbourg is the perfect destination for anyone looking to explore national parks and protected areas in Europe.
