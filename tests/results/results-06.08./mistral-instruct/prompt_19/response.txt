Based on your interests, I recommend visiting the fashion quarters of Rome and Milan. Both cities are known for their fashion and have many high-end and designer boutiques. In Rome, you can find the fashion district in the historic center, around Via del Corso and Via Giulia. Milan has several fashion districts, including the Quadrilatero della Moda, which is home to some of the world's most famous designers.

In terms of shopping malls, Rome has a few large shopping centers, such as the Euromarket and the Citylife. Milan has many shopping centers as well, including the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and the Corso Como.

If you are interested in visiting other cities, I can provide information on other cities as well. Just let me know which cities you are interested in.
