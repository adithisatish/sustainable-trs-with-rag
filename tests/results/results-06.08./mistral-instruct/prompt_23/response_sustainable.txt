I recommend Plovdiv in Bulgaria for March. The city offers many things to do, and most are easily walkable. The Hills are a must-visit, especially during sunset. The Old Town is also a must-see, full of art, free of cars, and enjoyable to walk around. The Center is another great place to visit, with its main walking street, shops, galleries, and cafes. Additionally, Plovdiv Jazz Nights is a low-key but high-quality 3-day event featuring some of the nation's best musicians. Asenovgrad Krepost is also a perfect day trip, with many bus connections available.
