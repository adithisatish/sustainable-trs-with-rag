I recommend Mykolaiv in Ukraine. It has a high sustainability score of 0.266 and offers a variety of water and sand activities, as well as cultural and historical attractions. The city is known for its Ukrainian theatre, Russian drama theatre, zoo, museums, and religious landmarks. Additionally, Mykolaiv has a vibrant nightlife scene with beautiful parks and shopping opportunities.
