I recommend Strasbourg, France. Strasbourg is a beautiful city with a rich history and culture. The old town is full of charming streets and cafes, and the Rhine River offers scenic boat tours. Additionally, Strasbourg has a thriving football scene, with the local team, RC Strasbourg Alsace, playing in Ligue 1. The city is also known for its Christmas markets, which are some of the best and most beautiful in Europe.
