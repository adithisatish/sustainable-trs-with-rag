I recommend Varna for a family vacation with theme parks and attractions in August. The city is known for its beautiful beaches, which are particularly lively at night, and there are also many clubs and bars in the city. Varna has a rich cultural heritage, with a museum of shipbuilding and fleet, and a museum of arts. Additionally, the city has a lively pedestrian-friendly center that is perfect for exploring on foot or by bicycle. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Varna in August is 0.397.
