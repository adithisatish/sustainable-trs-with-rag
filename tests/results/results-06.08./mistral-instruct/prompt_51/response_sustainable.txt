I recommend Stockholm in August. Stockholm is a city in Sweden with a sustainability score of 0.06 in August. It is primarily a business city, but it also has several business hotels that charge 900-1200&nbsp;kr for a single room. Many hotels have basement rooms without windows, which are significantly cheaper. Stockholm has some spectacular hostels, such as af Chapman, LÃ¥ngholmen, and Jumbostay. The lowest cost per bed can be found on the Baltic Sea ferries. Additionally, hospitality exchange and home exchange options can be useful for Stockholm.
