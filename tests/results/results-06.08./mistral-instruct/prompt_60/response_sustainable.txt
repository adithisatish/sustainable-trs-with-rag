I recommend visiting Strasbourg in France in May. Strasbourg is a city with a rich history and culture, and it's known for its beautiful historical center, which was the first city center to be classified entirely as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Additionally, Strasbourg is home to a number of important European institutions, making it an ideal destination for anyone interested in academic and historical pursuits. The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Strasbourg in May is 0.181, which is a good indication of the city's eco-friendliness and commitment to sustainability.
