I recommend Strasbourg for March. Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination with a beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city center that can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. The city is also home to several museums and galleries that showcase contemporary art and modern art, making it an ideal destination for art lovers. Additionally, Strasbourg's appeal brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market.
