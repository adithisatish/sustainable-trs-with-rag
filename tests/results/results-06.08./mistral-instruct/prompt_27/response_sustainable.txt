I recommend Strasbourg in France for your cycling and scenic bike route in June. Strasbourg offers a variety of bike paths along the Rhine River, which provide stunning views of the city and its surroundings. Additionally, the city is known for its charming old town, which is perfect for walking and exploring on foot. Strasbourg also has a rich cultural heritage, with numerous museums, galleries, and historical landmarks to discover. With its beautiful architecture, delicious cuisine, and lively atmosphere, Strasbourg is the perfect destination for a memorable cycling adventure in Europe.
