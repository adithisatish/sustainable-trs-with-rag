 I recommend Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. It's an excellent choice for you because it offers a lively nightlife scene, with various bars, clubs, and tavernas scattered throughout the city. The city's medieval quarter, Casco Viejo, is particularly popular, with its narrow streets and picturesque squares. You can find everything from traditional Basque-rock bars to more modern clubs and electronic music venues. Additionally, the city's proximity to the coast and its beautiful beaches make it an ideal destination for a summer vacation. The ideal month to visit Vitoria-Gasteiz is July, when the weather is warm and sunny, and the city's nightlife is in full swing.
