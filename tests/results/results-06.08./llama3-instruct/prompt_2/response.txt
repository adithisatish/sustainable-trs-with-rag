 I recommend Sardinero Beach in Santander, Spain. I chose this city because it has a lot of fine beaches, and Sardinero Beach is one of the most famous and popular ones in the city. The beach is about 3 km long and is less crowded than beaches in the city center. You can enjoy swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing on the beach. The beach is also surrounded by beautiful cliffs and offers stunning views of the Bay of Santander. The city has a lot of cultural events and festivals throughout the year, which can be enjoyed by visitors. The weather in Santander is mild and pleasant during the summer months, making it an ideal destination for a summer trip. [/INST]
