 I recommend Strasbourg, France, in April. The city's beautiful parks and gardens are perfect for birdwatching, and the city's many walking trails and boat tours offer plenty of opportunities for wildlife photography. Additionally, April is a great time to visit Strasbourg, as the weather is mild and sunny, making it an ideal time to explore the city's outdoor attractions. The city's Christmas markets are also a great attraction, and April is a great time to visit before the summer crowds arrive. [/INST]
