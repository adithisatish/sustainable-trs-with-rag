 I recommend Milan, Italy in May. Milan is an excellent choice for you, considering your interest in classical music and opera. La Scala, one of the world's most famous opera houses, is located in Milan. The city also hosts various musical events, including the Salone del Mobile, which is a significant fair in the world of design. Additionally, the city has a rich history and culture, with many museums, galleries, and historic landmarks to explore. May is a great time to visit Milan, as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for outdoor activities and sightseeing. I recommend taking a stroll along the Navigli, a charming canal district, and enjoying the city's vibrant atmosphere. [/INST]
