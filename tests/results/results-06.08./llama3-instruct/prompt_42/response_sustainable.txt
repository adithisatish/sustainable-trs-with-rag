 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is known for its picturesque town, rich history, and cultural attractions. The city has a charming old town with cobblestone streets and beautiful architecture, which is perfect for photography. Additionally, Strasbourg has a beautiful riverfront area along the Rhine, which offers stunning views and boat tours. The city also has a rich cultural scene, with numerous museums, theaters, and festivals throughout the year. July is a great time to visit Strasbourg, as the weather is warm and sunny, and the city's famous Christmas markets are not yet open, making it a more relaxed and peaceful destination.
