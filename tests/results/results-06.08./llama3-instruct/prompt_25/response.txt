 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it is known for its vibrant cultural festival scene, and September is an excellent time to visit, as it hosts the Corso Leopold street fair, which attracts large tour groups. The city also has a rich history and architecture, with many pedestrian-friendly streets and parks to explore. Additionally, Strasbourg is home to the European Parliament, making it an important hub for international politics and culture. With its unique blend of French and German influences, Strasbourg offers a unique cultural experience that is sure to delight visitors.
