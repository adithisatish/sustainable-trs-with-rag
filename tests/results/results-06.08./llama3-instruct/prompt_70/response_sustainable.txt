 I recommend Sibiu, Romania. Sibiu is an excellent choice for visiting historic marketplaces and bazaars. The city is known for its well-preserved medieval architecture, with many buildings dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries. The city's old town is filled with colorful buildings, narrow streets, and numerous shops, including many souvenir and craft shops. The Piata Mica, a small square, is a hub of activity, with many shops, cafes, and restaurants. Additionally, Sibiu has a rich cultural heritage, with many festivals and events taking place throughout the year. July is an excellent time to visit Sibiu, with warm weather and a lively atmosphere. The city's sustainability score is also relatively high, making it an environmentally friendly destination.
