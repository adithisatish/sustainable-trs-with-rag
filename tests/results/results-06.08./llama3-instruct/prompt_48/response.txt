 I recommend Munich, Germany, in May. The city hosts the Tollwood music festival, which takes place in May, featuring a variety of musical acts. Additionally, the city's Lange Nacht der Musik event in May offers an all-night music extravaganza with 400 concerts and shuttle buses between venues. These events make Munich an excellent choice for music lovers in May.
