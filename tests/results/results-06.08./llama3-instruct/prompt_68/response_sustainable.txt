 I recommend Bordeaux, France. I recommend Bordeaux because it is a city with a rich wine culture, and February is a great time to visit for wine tasting and vineyard tours. The city has a long history of wine production, and you can visit many châteaux and vineyards to learn about the wine-making process and taste some of the best wines in the world. The Musée du Vin et du Négoce is a great place to start your wine journey, and you can also take a guided tour to learn more about the wine industry. Additionally, Bordeaux has a lot to offer in terms of culture, history, and architecture, making it a great destination for a romantic getaway.
