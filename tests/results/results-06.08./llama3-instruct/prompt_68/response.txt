 I recommend Bordeaux, France. I chose Bordeaux because it is a city famous for its wine production and vineyards. In February, the weather is mild, with average highs around 12°C (54°F), making it an ideal time to visit. The city offers a variety of wine-related activities, such as wine tastings and vineyard tours, which will allow you to experience the rich wine culture of the region. Additionally, the city's pedestrian centre is full of shops, restaurants, and cafes, providing a lively atmosphere to enjoy during your romantic getaway.
