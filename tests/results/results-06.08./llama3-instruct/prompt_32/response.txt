 I recommend Strasbourg, France. As you are interested in exploring UNESCO World Heritage sites, Strasbourg is an excellent choice. The city's cathedral, the Notre-Dame de Strasbourg, is one of the finest Gothic buildings in Europe and has been included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Additionally, the city's historic center, including the Place du Marché aux Poissons, Place de la Cathédrale, and the Petite France district, is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city's rich history and cultural heritage make it an ideal destination for cultural enthusiasts. The ideal time to visit Strasbourg is during the summer months, as the city's Christmas markets are a major tourist attraction during the winter season.
