 I recommend Strasbourg, France. I recommend Strasbourg because it offers scenic train rides through beautiful landscapes. The city is famous for its picturesque train route, which runs along the Rhine River and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The train route is also a popular tourist destination, with many tourists visiting the city specifically to take the train ride. The city's pedestrian-friendly center is also worth exploring, with many shops, restaurants, and historical landmarks to discover. The ideal month to visit Strasbourg is May, when the weather is mild and sunny, making it an ideal time to enjoy the city's scenic train route and outdoor attractions.
