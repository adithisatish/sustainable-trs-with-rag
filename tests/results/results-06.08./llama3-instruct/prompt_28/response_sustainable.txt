 I recommend Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I chose Plovdiv because it is an ancient city with a rich history and cultural heritage, which is reflected in its numerous art galleries, museums, and exhibitions. The city has been named the European Capital of Culture for 2019, which is a testament to its vibrant cultural scene. In October, the city is likely to have a pleasant autumn weather, making it an ideal time to visit. Additionally, Plovdiv's affordability and relatively low tourist season in October make it an excellent choice for travelers looking for a unique cultural experience without the crowds. [/INST]
