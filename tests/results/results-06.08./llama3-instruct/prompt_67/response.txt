 I recommend Craiova, Romania, and Strasbourg, France. Both cities have a rich history and culture, and they offer a unique experience of vibrant street art and graffiti. Craiova has a strong artistic vibe, with the Art Palace and Nicolae Romanescu Park, while Strasbourg has a beautiful old town with a variety of street art and graffiti. Both cities are worth visiting, especially during the summer months when the weather is warm and sunny. The ideal month to visit would be July, which is peak tourist season, but both cities are also worth visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) when the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are smaller. The provided context does not have the answer, so I recommend Craiova and Strasbourg based on the information provided. [/INST] I recommend Craiova, Romania, and Strasbourg, France.
