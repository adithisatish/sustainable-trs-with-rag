 I recommend Tallinn, Estonia. Tallinn is an excellent choice for your scenic lake and boat ride experience in July. The city has a beautiful Old Town with a well-preserved medieval architecture, and its scenic lake, Lake Ãœlemiste, is a popular spot for boating and swimming. In July, you can enjoy the warm weather and take a boat ride on the lake, which is surrounded by beautiful parks and green areas. Additionally, Tallinn has a rich cultural scene, with many museums, galleries, and festivals throughout the year. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, with many bars, clubs, and restaurants to choose from.
