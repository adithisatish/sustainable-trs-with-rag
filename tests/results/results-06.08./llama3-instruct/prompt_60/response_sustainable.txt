 I recommend Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in May. I recommend Plovdiv because it is known for its rich history and academic background, being one of the oldest cities in Europe. The city has a long history of academic and cultural achievements, and it has been a hub for learning and knowledge for centuries. The city's historic centre, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a must-visit, and it's an ideal destination for someone interested in historic universities and academic towns. May is an excellent time to visit Plovdiv, with pleasant weather and a vibrant atmosphere. The city's cultural events and festivals, such as the Plovdiv International Festival, usually take place in May, making it an even more exciting time to visit.
