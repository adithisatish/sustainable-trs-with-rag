 I recommend Munich, Germany. Munich is an excellent destination in spring, with a plethora of festivals and celebrations taking place during this season. The city hosts various events, such as St. Patrick's Day, May Day, Lange Nacht der Musik, and Oktoberfest, among others. These events offer a unique cultural experience, with a mix of music, food, and festivities. The city's vibrant atmosphere and picturesque surroundings make it an ideal destination for travelers looking to experience the best of Europe in the spring.
