 I recommend Gaziantep because it has a castle, explore the bazaars and don't forget the museum. There are a lot of museums in the center of city, especially some of them are close to castle. You should go Mosaic Museum (close to stadium), Medusa Museum (Glass Museum), Martyr's Museum, Dervishes Museum (''Mevlevihane''), Hasan Süzer Etnographia Museum.
Walk around the narrow streets of the old town: between Attatürk bd. and Eyüpoglu cd. Sit in one of the Syrian-style cafes located in adorable courtyards and enjoy a tea, a lemonade or a meal. 
Gaziantep is a quiet and peaceful city, it has a lot of parks, walking around the city in the parks is very pleasant.
