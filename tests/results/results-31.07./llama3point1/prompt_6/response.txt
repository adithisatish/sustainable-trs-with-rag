 I recommend Bratislava because it is a city in Slovakia. Here is some information about the city. Bryndzové halušky (small, spaetzle-like dumplings with sheep's cheese and topped with pieces of meat) is the national dish of Slovakia and recommended to try. Potent garlic soup (but perhaps not on a date) and Slovak white wine (due to its cooler climate, Slovakia's reds pale in comparison with some of Europe's other offerings), schnitzels, goulashes and other typically Central European foods. In December, don't miss the Christmas market in front of the Old Town Hall. The traditional foods of the Christmas market are roasted pork or chicken sandwich burgers ("ciganska pecienka") with mustard and onions, potato pancakes ("loksa") with various fillings ranging traditionally from plain ones with goose fat, with garlic or goose liver to poppy seed, nut or chocolate. Bread with pork fat and onions is also popular. Also there are a few stands which offer specialities from other European countries. You can wash down the food with a cup of red or white mulled wine or a small cup of honey wine, also tea with or without rum is available, as well as grog or other "hot mixed drinks" like the Červený medveď (red bear). There are a large number of restaurants in the center of Bratislava in all price ranges so there are plenty to choose from. Budget Bratislava's special form of junk food is richman, a big bread roll filled with cabbage and cheese and/or meat with mayonnaise. Richman stands can be found on Kamenné námestie, in front of the Tesco building, and in Safarikovo square. You can also try a sub sandwich from one of the many cafeterias in the city. Another excellent cafeteria is on Zelená Ulica between Ventúrska Ulica and Hlavné námestie. A big sandwich, a bageta (from the French baguette) with cheese, ham and eggs would cost you about €1.50. Another specialty in Bratislava (but also available in other regions of Slovakia) is treska. It is a cold salad made of cod (fish) with mayonnaise. There are also vegetables such as onions and carrots in the salad. It has a distinctive taste, somewhere between sour and bitter. You can buy it fresh in most "Lahódky" shops, which means something like "delicacies", but generally stands for old-fashioned fast food shops which sell salads, soups, etc. Treska is very good with rolls. Can also buy it packed to take home. If you want to self-cater, the largest supermarket near the centre is the underground Tesco on Kamenné námestie ({{rint|tram}} Centrum). You could easily have lunch consisting of a couple of bread rolls, ham, cheese, fruit and maybe a cake or two, for €3-4. New shopping malls with big cinemas and of course food courts within reach of the centre are Aupark on the right bank of the Danube (next to Sad Janka Kráľa park, some 10 minutes from St Martins's Cathedral), Eurovea (next to the old bridge on the old town bank of river, close to the bus station), Polus City Center on Vajnorská Street to the north of the city (some 10–15 minutes from the city by tram) and Bory Mall on the north-western edge of the city.
