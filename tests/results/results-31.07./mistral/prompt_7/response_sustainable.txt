 Option 3: Luxembourg is a city in Luxembourg.The sustainability (or s-fairness) score for Luxembourg in May is 0.444. 
 Here is some information about the city. You may not expect it from one of the smallest countries in [[Europe]], but The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a diverse land, full of beautiful nature and gorgeous historic monuments. Its turbulent history is filled with stories of emperors and counts as well as many battles and disputes. Today, the almost fairy-tale like castles and fortresses are a faint but impressive reminder of those days, and amidst their lovely natural setting, they make some superb and picturesque sights.

Most of the country's population lives in rural areas and apart from the delightful historic '''[[Luxembourg (city)|City of Luxembourg]]''', the country's capital, settlements are mostly small. That said, the capital is a place not to be missed. It has a splendid location high on a cliff, overlooking the deep and narrow valleys of the Alzette and Pétrusse rivers. Several parts of the old town are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the most interesting places include the Gothic '''Cathedral of Notre Dame''', the town '''fortifications''', and of course the '''Grand Ducal Palace''', which is surrounded by charming cobblestoned lanes. However, there's far more to see, such as the '''Bock casemates, Neumünster Abbey''' and the '''Place d'Armes'''. There are several World War II memorial sites and a number of high-end museums, but just wandering through the old centre, taking in the beautiful views from the '''Chemin de la Corniche''' and crossing bridges to the nearest plateaus is at least as great a way to discover the city.

The lively town of '''[[Echternach]]''' is the oldest city in Luxembourg. It boasts the country's most prominent religious structure, the '''basilica''' of the Abbey of Echternach where the country's patron St Willibrord is buried. The annual Whit Tuesday celebrations in his honour involve lots of dancers in the old town centre and are a popular tourist attraction. Apart from its own sights, Echternach makes a great base to explore the beautiful '''[[Müllerthal]]''', better known as "Little Switzerland". Hike or bike through its dense forests with myriad streams and even some caves.

The romantic village of '''[[Vianden]]''' with its stunning medieval castle is a tourists' favourite and well worth a visit even despite the crowds in summer. The beautiful location of the fortress in the Our river valley, surrounded by tight forests and a lake with swans, gives it a typical fairy-tale castle look and feel. If you're done wandering the streets and exploring the Goth
