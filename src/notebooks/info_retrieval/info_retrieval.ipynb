Advance booking is recommended, especially for weekends and holidays. Don\\'t expect you\\'ll find an affordable bed once you\\'re here. Most hotels and hostels can be found in the [[Amsterdam/Binnenstad|Binnenstad]], notably south of Centraal Station, and in [[Amsterdam/Zuid|Zuid]] around the Museum Quarter. Charming boutique accommodation can be found in the wealthy residential [[Amsterdam/Canal District|Canal District]], home to the rich and famous and its squares are the prime nightlife spots of the city. The [[Amsterdam/Jordaan|Jordaan]] is another area for hip boutique accommodations, slightly upmarket, but still for mid-range prices. Some cheaper hostels can also be found in the [[Amsterdam/Binnenstad|Red Light District]].\\nA simple bed in a [[hostel]] starts around {{EUR|18}} on weekdays in the winter and up to {{EUR|90}} on a weekend in the summer. Hostels often expect you to book at least 2 nights in a weekend. A twin room in a budget hotel, 1-2 stars, might cost around {{EUR|40}} on weekdays in the winter and up to {{EUR|100}} on summer weekends. In a three and four-star hotel, the prices would range from {{EUR|100}} to {{EUR|200}}, depending on season, and five-star hotels can cost between {{EUR|150}} and {{EUR|400}} a night. As a rule of thumb, summer is high season and price can be double compared to winter times. September and October tend to be cheaper months to travel.\\nDo not expect a wide number of services from cheaper end hostels and hotels. Most of these do not have elevators and have the usual steep staircases; if you suffer from vertigo, do get an assurance that you will be getting a first or second floor room or book a hotel that has an elevator.\\nIf you are looking for a reasonably priced hostel and cannot find any in whole Amsterdam (especially on summer weekends), check the hostels in Purmerend (Hostel 45, City Trip) and Zandaam (Room Mate, City Trip). They lie outside of the Amsterdam city borders and so aren\\'t displayed if looking for accommodation in \"Amsterdam\" at online travel agencies.

It is located to the west of Burgas. The water is 4-11% salty. Fresh water comes from 3 rivers and the neighboring  Mandrensko lake that is turned to dam. The lake waters are dirty and it is not recommended to swim there. A lot of people go fishing there.

The buildings were erected between the 15th and the 17th centuries, notably by wealthy Italian, Flemish and German merchants who settled in Lyon where four fairs were held each year. At that time, the buildings of Lyon were said to be the highest in Europe. The area was entirely refurbished in the 1980s and 1990s.

Behind the church, the calvary built in 1687 is also a great viewpoint.\\n}}\\n===Croix-Rousse===\\nThe area, especially the traboules, may be worth taking a guided tour (available from the tourist office).\\nCroix-Rousse is known as the \"working hill\" but for centuries, it had been as much of a \"praying hill\" as Fourvière. On the slopes was the Roman Federal Sanctuary of the Three Gauls, which comprised the amphitheatre (built in 19 BC) and an altar (built in 12 BC). This sanctuary was abandoned at the end of the 2nd century. In the Middle Ages, the hill, then called Montagne St Sébastien, was not part of the free town of Lyon but of the Franc-Lyonnais province, which was independent and protected by the King. The slopes were then dedicated to agriculture, mostly vineyards. In 1512, a fortified wall was built at the top of the hill, approximately where Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse is today. The \\'\\'pentes\\'\\' (slopes) and the plateau were therefore separated. The slopes became then part of Lyon while the plateau was outside the borders of the city. Up to thirteen religious congregations then settled on the slopes and acquired vast pieces of land. Their possessions were seized and many buildings destroyed during the French Revolution.\\nCroix-Rousse is known as the main silk production area, but the industry did not exist on the hill until the early 19th century and the introduction of new weaving technology; at that time, silk had already been produced in Lyon for over 250 years. The industry gave birth to a unique architecture: the \\'\\'canuts\\'\\'\\' apartments had very high ceilings to accommodate the newly introduced Jacquard looms, which were up to 4 metres high; tall windows gave the necessary natural lighting for the delicate work; and mezzanines provided space for family life. The neighbourhood is still one of the most densely populated in Europe. The first revolt of the \\'\\'canuts\\'\\' in 1831 is regarded as one of the first social conflicts of the industrial era. It gave the hill its reputation of a \"rebel\" neighbourhood. In 1852, the \\'\\'commune\\'\\' (town) of Croix-Rousse, actually the plateau, was made a district of Lyon. Local people still talk about \"going to Lyon\" when they go down to the city centre. Then important works were undertaken, such as the construction of the first funicular in the world, linking the plateau to central Lyon (it started in Rue Terme; the tunnel is now a road tunnel), or the creation of the Croix-Rousse hospital.\\nNowadays the plateau keeps a \"village\" mood, the slopes still have a \"rebel\" spirit, with many artists and associations based there, but the sociology of the neighbourhood has considerably evolved with the renovation works and the subsequent rise in real estate prices and massive arrival of upper-middle-class families (\\'\\'bobos\\'\\'). Local authorities, however, are committed to preserving social diversity.\\nThe name \"Croix-Rousse\" comes from a limestone cross which was erected at the top of the hill in the beginning of the 16th century. It was then destroyed and rebuilt several times. A replica installed in 1994 can be seen on Place Joannès Ambre (between the hospital and Croix-Rousse theatre).\\n*{{see\\n| name=Amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=rue Lucien Sportisse | lat=45.770556 | long=4.830556 | directions=M: Hôtel de Ville\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls | image=03.

It also represents a large part of the city\\'s economic activity.\\nThis narrow peninsula between the Rhône and Saône rivers was largely shaped by man. When the first inhabitants settled on what was then called \\'\\'Canabae\\'\\', the junction of the river was near the current site of St Martin d\\'Ainay basilica. South of this point was an island. From 1772, titanic works led by engineer Antoine-Michel Perrache reunited the island to the mainland. The swamps which existed there were then dried out, which allowed the construction of Perrache station, opened in 1846. Northern Presqu\\'île was largely redesigned from 1848; the only remaining Renaissance part is around rue Mercière.\\nMost of the action on Presqu\\'île actually takes place between Terreaux and Bellecour. Between Bellecour and Perrache, the neighbourhood of Ainay is traditionally home to the Catholic bourgeoisie. Perrache station and its \"exchange centre\" (freeway interchange, car parks, metro and bus station) are a very important border; going from one side to the other is a challenge, be it on foot or by car. The area south of Perrache is dealt with in the next section.\\n*{{see\\n| name=Place des Terreaux | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=45.767481 | long=4.833486 | directions=M: Hôtel de Ville\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Place des Terreaux | image=Place des Terreaux - 2.JPG | wikidata=Q1506\\n| content=This large square was completely redesigned in the 1990s by the artist Daniel Buren.

There used to be two prisons (closed Apr 2009), a wholesale food market (which moved to Corbas in the southern suburbs) and large warehouses and workshops belonging the national railway company SNCF. One of the largest development plans in Europe was put under way a few years ago with the construction of a new tram line and the opening of a cultural centre (\\'\\'La Sucrière\\'\\'). The Western side of the area now boasts a number of new buildings, most of which are interesting pieces of contemporary architecture. The new headquarters for the government of Rhône-Alpes region has just been put into service, and a new mall is well under way. A new phase of the project is about to start with the demolition of the huge former wholesale market.\\nSo far there is one major attraction: the \"Musée des Confluences\", which opened in 2014 and is becoming a must-see for its architectural audacity and its art collections. Otherwise, it is interesting to take a walk or a bicycle ride there to see how Lyon can still be evolving after 2000 years of history.\\n===Other areas===\\n\\n*{{see\\n| name=Cité Internationale | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=quai Charles de Gaulle | lat=45.7849 | long=4.85426 | directions=B: C1\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Cité Internationale | image=Vue Salle3000 Lyon Helicoptere.jpg | wikidata=Q5273\\n| lastedit=2018-11-12\\n| content=This business and residential area in an important urban project for Lyon.

The aim is to create a 22km-long promenade between along the Saône banks, separated into two parts (for now): between Confluence and \\'\\'île Barbe\\'\\', and between the neighboring cities of Fontaines-sur-Saône and Rochetaillée-sur-Saône (north of Lyon). Work is still ongoing but some portions are already open. The promenade extends largely into suburban teritory and is much greener than the Rhône banks. The portion near Rochetaillée features many waterside restaurants (\\'\\'guinguettes\\'\\') serving fresh fish.\\n}}\\n*{{see\\n| name=Parc Sergent Blandan | alt= | url=https://www.grandlyon.com/a-vivre/parc-blandan.html | email=\\n| address=rue du Repos, rue de l\\'Epargne, boulevard des Tchécoslovaques | lat=45.745 | long=4.854 | directions=T: Lycée Colbert\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q16668902\\n| content=A park built on the grounds of former military barracks.
